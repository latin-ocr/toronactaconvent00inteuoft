Rom-:RT w. CARRUBBA 267

Appendix

Since Kaempfer’s Latin text has not been translated into any language, 1
have provided an English version of his report on the whirlpools of the

Caspian Sea and his description of the Amygdalus marina (Amoenitatum
Exoticamm, pp. 253—58).

The Absence of WhirlpooLs in the Caspian Sea

Τὴε inland lake of Asia, which the Romans call the Caspian, the Russians
term Galenskoi More (Hyrcanian Sea), the Persians name Deija Kulsum,
and the Turks label Bohaar Korsurm (the closed sea), has wonderfully
exercised the minds of philosophers, with no harm to those who are
baffled. The issue in question is: that a basin enclosed on all sides accepts
the force of rivers of near and distant origin without first overflowing‚
then crossing its shores and flooding the adjacent lands with a constant
deluge. Athanasius Kircher‚ that Pliny of our era, has addressed the
solution to this problem with a great effort. By an ingenious conjecture he
energetically cuts through the earth and conducts water from the depths
of the Caspian Sea on one side into the Black Sea and on the other side
into the Persian Gulf. In this process, he relies on the condition of the
aforementioned bodies of water and certain phenomena therein which
that very learned gentleman, out of trust, believed that an untruthful
reporter had in fact observed. He excited the puzzled minds of scholars so
that they thought that they had escaped the impervious labyrinth of nature
by grasping these whirlpools, so consonant with reason, so wonderful to
the ordinary person and so precious to the mystics of nature, as if they
were grasping the thread of Ariadne. And behold: all the travelers, who
crossed this sea, henceforth freely confirm the presence of whirlpools
which they have not seen, and in concert they do not hesitate to insert
them on the hydrographic charts. To be sure, because they have been
unduly persuaded of the existence of whirlpools, these writers escape the
blame for sloth and negligence, and ever strive to please their readers with
accounts of wonderful things.

1 assert that these eddying whirlpoolS, visible indeed, and appean'ng on
the surface of the sea, are pure figments (but on this side of the contempt
of writers). As witnesses I have the Tartarean, Russian and Persian inhabit-
ants around the Caspian Sea who have sworn by God and all things holy
that they have not observed whirlpools. As witnesses I have the sailors and
their seafan'ng comrades who have from childhood traveled on their ships
