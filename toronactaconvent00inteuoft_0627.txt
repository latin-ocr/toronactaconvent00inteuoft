STELLA P. REVARD 603

Beauty is both; for with the Faim
What Arms, what Amour can compare? (13-14)

Having made beauty both an offensive and a defensive force, Cowley goes
on to allude to a story outside the confines of his original anacreontic. It
is the paradoxical tale of Beauty's queen, Venus, who best puts on arms,
not when she dresses in Mars’ armor, but when she undresses. Several
well-known epigrams from the Greek Anthology tell the story from
different vantage points, and neo-Latin and vernacular poets in turn
produce imitations of the Greek epigrams. The first of these, attributed to
Leonidas of Alexandria (Appendix manuam, IV. xvi. 171), directly ques-
tions Venus on putting on Mars' armor. Cowley's friend, the poet Richard
Crashaw, renders it in this way:

What? Mars his sword? faire Cytherea say,
Why art thou arm’d so desperately to day?
Mars thou has beaten naked, and ὀ then
What need’st thou put on armes against poore men?¹⁶

The second, a Latin epigram attributed to Ausonius (lxiii [xlii]), records
Pallas’ quip on seeing Venus armed: “Why bear arms, since you conquer
naked?‘’ Both Ludovico An'osto and Antonio Minturno wrote imitations
in Latin, and Crashaw has an English version.¹⁷ Cowley is certainly aware

¹⁷ See Ludovicus Areostus, Carmina (with Pigna and Calcagnini) (Venice, 1554). In
the epigram, Pallas, on seeing Venus in armor, says:

Nil opus est ferro, ferri cum nuda potentem
Exueris spolijs omnibus ipsa Deum. (p. 296)

Also see “De Venere Armata” in Antonio Sebestiano Minturno, Epigrammata, et Elegiae
(Venice, 1564).

Armatum Venerem aspiceret cum caesia Pallas,
Vis Cypri indicium sic subeamus? ait.
Quae tenerum ridens, clypeos attollere contra,
Audes: si vici nuda, quid arma ferens? (p. 3)

Crashaw’s version of the same epigram runs thus:

Pallas saw Venus arm’d, and streight she cry’d,
Come if thou dar'st‚ thus, thus let us be try’d,
why soole! saies Venus, thus provok'st thou mee,
That being nak’t, thou know'st could conquer thee?

(p. 161)
