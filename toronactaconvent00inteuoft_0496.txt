472 JOHANNES MURMELLms' SCOPARIUS

Bomer and Nauwelaerts.⁵ However, none of these treatments has added
appreciably to the useful commentaries in Bomer’s critical edition of the
Scoparius, published at the end of the last century as part of Murmellius’
complete works.⁶ My purpose here is to summarize and to interpret
Murmellius’ arguments in the Scoparius‚ as another German defense of
humanistic study. I shall also place its publication within a biographical
context. Unfortunately, limitations of time and space do not allow exten-
sive comparison of arguments in the Murmellius text with other Northern
and Italian defenses of poetry. Furthermore‚ a comparison of textual
differences in the 1517 Deventer and the 1518 Cologne editions, and how
those emendations may be explained by events of the Reuchlin affair, will
have to be explored in another paper.

Along with Alexander Hegius and Rudolf von Langen, Murmellius
ranks as one of the most famous “schoolteacher humanists” of the Lower
Rhineland and Westphalia during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth
centuries. Born in 1480 in Roermond (a fact memorialized often in his
signature—Johannes Murmellius Ruremundensis)‚ he attended the famous
Latin School of Hegius in Deventer. In 1496 Murmellius continued his
studies at the University of Cologne, where he received his undergraduate
and two graduate degrees.⁷ Through the patronage of Langen, he was
appointed assistant rector at the cathedral school in Miinster. It was in
that Westphalian town that Murmellius pursued his early career as a
teacher, headmaster, proponent of educational reform, and prolific
author. Nauwelaerts‚ who has compiled the most current bibliography of
his writings, lists forty—nine publications down to 1517, many of which
were reprinted.⁸ They include original works of poetry, editions of the
pagan and Christian classics, and practical textbooks to encourage the
reform of Latin grammar and rhetoric, intended for both teachers and
students. Murmellius’ Pappa puerorum, by far the most popular of his
handbooks, was reprinted thirty-one times and used in every part of
Europe.⁹ Following a dispute with the headmaster of the cathedral school,
