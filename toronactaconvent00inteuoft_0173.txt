D on the classification and arguments of letters. In these citations, Eras-
mus’ description of his friend Jacobus Tutor as Handwerpiae agens, that is,
pensionary of Antwerp, establishes a terminus post quem of late 1505 for the
manuscript Despauterius saw, and other internal evidence suggests that
Erasmus completed this stage of the revision by August 1506, perhaps
when he stopped in Paris that summer en route from England to Italy.
Despauterius, who had known Erasmus at Louvain from 1502 to 1504,
might have obtained the manuscript from his publisher Badius, with
whom Erasmus had left other papers, or from another mutual friend. In
late 1508, Erasmus was working at the Aldine press in Venice, and there
is no evidence to suggest that he sent the manuscript back to Paris or
Louvain from Italy.

In any event, Erasmus must have written this version of the treatise
before 6 April 1509, when he heard the Good Friday sermon addressed to
the Pope in Rome that he criticized in the Ciceronianus (ASD I—2: 637-39).
Scholars have assumed that his anti-Ciceronianism began in reaction to
this and other experiences in Italy, but Erasmus was already seeking a
practical via media between barbaric medieval formulas and an equally
legalistic neo-classical purism. Despauterius quotes Erasmus’ amusing
parody of the medieval salutation and his attack on the pretentious titles
assumed by theologians and other clerics (ASD 1—2: 282-83, 293—95). He
also quotes from seven of the first eight chapters of the Opus. In these
chapters, 1 have argued, Erasmus answers the Ciceronians.¹¹ He asserts
that letter—writing cannot be limited to a simple, artless, conversational
style. Letters can treat any subject. They are written to an individual, not
to a general audience. Therefore, the writer must observe decorum,
varying his style to suit his matter and the circumstances and personality
of his correspondent. The letter “is by nature diverse and capable of
almost infinite variation”; “it should be flexible, and, as the polyp adapts
itself to every condition of its surroundings, so a letter should adapt itself
to every kind of subject and circumstance.''¹² Erasmus' argument echoes
Poliziano, as Despauterius observes in his note on the opening chapter of
the Opus in Annotationes ad Syntaxim ([Paris]:J. Badius, [1510]).

Although in 1515 and 1517 Beatus Rhenanus urged Erasmus to prepare
his treatise for Froben’s press (epp. 330, 581), he completed it only when
the pirating of his early manuscripts from 1519 to 1521 forced him to do
so. Committed now to theology and embroiled in religious controversy, he
