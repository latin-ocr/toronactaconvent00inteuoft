370 ERASMUS'S EARLY PSALM COMMENTARIES

notion that the “pot of clay'' is one that has not yet been fired in the
oven, that the clay is still damp, and that there is thus a chance of rescuing
the material, to be reshaped by the heavenly potter [225D-227D]. Erasmus
justifies such subtlety on the grounds that his aim is to edify humanity:

Salvation is not imperilled by a slight departure from the original
sense of the scripture, so long as the new reading conforms to piety
and truth; even if our interpretation does not entirely fit into its
original context, our labours will have been more or less worthwhile
if our reading contributes to moral improvement, and fits in with
other scriptural texts. [274D]

The exposition of Psalm 1 was Erasmus's first published work of
scriptural exegesiS, and these four commentaries may be seen in part as an
extension of his contemporary work on the New Testament, since what he
seeks in them is Old Testament ratification and clarification of the promi&
es in which the Evangelical is to trust. Divinely inspired, the psalms are
almost like an extension to the New Testament:

Despite its extreme brevity‚ this [first] psalm deals with vital universal
themes . . . Although it is short, this one psalm [the fourth] would
enable us to win salvati0n‚ if we understood what we read, and put
that understanding into practice. [174B, 291D]

It was still possible in 1525-but only just—to propose “slight departures
from the original sense‚'' but it is noticeable that Erasmus’s later commen-
taries on the Psalms were mostly contributions to Reformation controver-
sy, especially the De puritate, De bello Turcico and De Ecclesiae concordia. But
in the first four, at least, Erasmus was inspired by the divine rhetoric of
the Holy Spirit to summon all Christians to abandon their worldliness and
embrace Christ.
