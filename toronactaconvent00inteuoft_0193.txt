this way Jephthah becomes a tragic hero, who adopts a wrong attitude
prompted by foolish emotions,⁶ which are ultimately determined by the
religious fanaticism of the age, and who is eventually ready for his ghastly
deed. This attitude and this political context represent, as it were, the
necessity, the ἀνάγκη, that often fetters heroes of Greek tragedy. In the
debate with the priest the role of jephthah is not unlike that of Creon in
Sophocles' Antigone. And the tragedy ofJephthah’s fate is transcended by
the sadness implied in Buchanan’s message: the sadness of a more ratio-
nalistic biblical-humanistic ethics, which is aware of it's own weak position
in sixteenth century society.

The drama as a whole, then, is not built up from the units of individua]
characters confronted with realistic situations or problems. Itis rather an
ongoing debate between emotions and ideas, each of which is embodied
in a particular character or the chorus, in a particular episode or an ode.⁷

§§§

When we turn from the neo-classical Latin schooldrama of Buchanan to
Vondel's Dutch play for the public theater, the transition is almost a
cultural shock. A simple enumeration of the most important differences
in the treatment of the subject matter may be of some help for a better
understanding of both tragedies:

l. Vondel’s drama does not consist of episodes and choral odes but of

ritualism (“not the letter but the spirit’')‚ and a line of reasoning by means of rhetori-
αι] commonplaces. It has been a persistent misapprehension to regard the position of
the priest as one that has to be judged negatively, e.g., as a kind of carioeture of the
shallow scholasticism of the Sorbonne, and to recognize true religious depth in the
stand ofJephthah; so for example R. Lebegue, La trage'die religieuse m France (Paris,
1929), 232 and Smit, op. cit., 2:269. Prof. Walsh agreed with me (orally at the Toronto
congress; cf. also his article cited in n. 3, 107-8) that Buchanan stands behind the
words of the priest, but as his sources he gives St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Jerome and
the Old Testament. Cf. also P. Sharrat in George Buchanan Tragedioe, eds. P. Sharrat
and P. G. Walsh (Edinburgh, 1983), Introduction, pp. 10-20). Prof. W. Nijenhuis
(University of Groningen) at my request kindly read the debate ofJephthah and the
priest in Buchanan. His comment on my suggestion of Erasmianism was: “The words
of the priest, though rather flat, fit in the climate of Erasmian humanism.Jephthah‚
too, is superficial. The debate is a skirmish of two moralists lacking real depth.’'

⁶ Perhaps the adfectibus stultis of vv. 931-32 as opposed to the adfectos sacros of v.
872 is an echo of the then modern doctrine of good and bad emotions, as put for-ward
by Vives (De anima et vita, 1538) and Melanchthon (De anima, 1540).
