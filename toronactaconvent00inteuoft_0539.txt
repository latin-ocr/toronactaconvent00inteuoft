literature is epideictic rhetoric, whose purpose is to praise or blame; and
partly a reflection of the thought—patterns actually discoverable in ancient
literature and consciously adopted. But the effect of thinking about texts
in terms of such headings is a uniform belief that there is a universe of
ideas proper to literature, to which all writing can and should refer and to
which Latin and Greek writing in particular has given privileged and
paradigmatic expression. Yet, at the same time as the subjects of literature
seem invariable, the production of language is seen as variety itself, with
open-ended lists of juxtaposed quotations stimulating the pursuit of
abundance, versatility and inventiveness. Variation on a theme or com-
monplace is the hallmark of Renaissance poetry, and so is the manipula-
tion of allusions to ancient texts, juxtaposed with each other or with the
new text to produce new meanings. The pleasures of Renaissance poetry
are as often as not the pleasures of intertextuality and recognition, which
poets learnt to give us by absorbing and reproducing the contents of the
commonplace books that they and their original readers had in common.

The connection between commonplace books and literary imitation has
at least two major corollaries, both of which bring us to the heart of the
humanist enterprise. One is the creation of a literature which is a code of
references and allusions understood only by an educated elite. Τὴε other
is ,that the commonplace-formula for writing raises in acute form the
question of the role of the new writer, the unique individual who wanders
like Seneca's honey·producing bee through anthologies culled from
ancient masters.⁷ When the commonplace-book mentality is adopted by
vernacular writers, the question is further complicated by the problematic
relationship of ancient languages and ancient models to modern languages
and forms. Pierre de Ronsard saw the commonplace book as a prototype
for a solution to the dilemma, enabling him to “run through his books,
collecting, sorting, selecting all the finest materials to paint a picture in a
hundred colours, of which he alone is master.'‘⁸ It is precisely the ar·
rangement of intertextual references which enables him to dominate them
and to speak with his own individual voice. Michel de Montaigne, as ever,
is more complex, but his Essais are a continuous dialogue between French

⁷ Seneca’s image (Epistulae morales, 84) finds a place in most prefaces to common-
place books, though editors may choose to emphasise different features in it. For a
