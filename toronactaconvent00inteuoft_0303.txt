inferior belonging to that excellent Belgian scholar Charles Lang,
but, to give each his due, [it owes its importance to the] industry of
the same Lang. For he had carefully collated the three manuscripts
and noted the variant readings on the manuscript which the bishop
of Antwerp lent me, the famous Torrentius. 1 have carefully indicat·
ed in my notes where they differed and have differentiated them in
the margin of my book with an initial. Ι have collated five printed
texts, two from the Aldine press of the year 1502 and 1519, the
others from Paris, Lyons, and Basel. There is also the old Venetian
edition of the year 1490. . . . Finally please be good enough to think
of my youth and to use the Lesbian rule⁸ and as it bends to fit the
structure, so fit your judgment to this tyro. . . . 1 conclude and Ι greet
you, reader, whoever you are.

The work of these four Renaissance commentators manifests a new
interest in and study of Statius during the period. Calderinus’s commen-
tary on the Silvae, which was virtually unknown during the Middle AgeS,
is the first extant commentary on that work. New interest in the Achilleia,
Statius‘ minor epic, is seen in the three commentaries of Maturantius,
Britannicus, and Bernartius. The story of the education and early life of
Achilles was of particular interest in the humanists’ view of education.
Preserved in some ninety-five manuscripts, the Achilleia circulated as one
of the six, and later eight, Latin texts in the popular schoolbook known
today as the Liber Catonianus. For the first time editions of commentaries
by different authors on all three of Statius's works begin to appear as well
as editions of commentan'es by a single author on three of Statius's work.
Yet the present study is preliminary and incomplete. Information regard-
ing the manuscript collections and early printed editions in Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, Eastern Europe, and Russia has not been easy to obtain.
Further research in the major libraries in these countries is necessary to
complete this study for the Catalogus Translationum et Commentariorum.

⁸ On the “Lesbian rule” see Erasmus, Adagia 1 v 93 = LB 11 217c‚ who cites
Aristode's Nic. Eth. 5.14 (=1137b 29-32) for the information that Lesbians used a
lcaden rule which changed shape to fit the shape of the stone. So Bernatius hopes that
the reader will be similarly accommodating in his judgment of the work. 1 am indeed
indebted to Professor Alexander Dalzell of Trinity College in the University of
Toronto for this reference and explanation and for his careful editing of this article
and also to my colleague Professor Anthony Damico of the University of North Texas
for his help with the obscure Latin.
