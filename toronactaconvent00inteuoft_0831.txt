concentrates on the loci α persona:

in deliberante, et nobis, et ceteris consultoribus, denique in una·
quaque persona, haec considerari debent, quae ante ipsam, quae
cum ipsa, quae post ipsam; ante ipsam sunt majores ejus, et veteres
omnes, hinc patria, tum quidquid actum, vel dictum est, quod ad
ipsum possit quoquo modo pertinere, aut ad rem de qua deliberatur,
velut exempla ex historia, ex fabulis, oracula, praedictiones, apoph-
thegmata, sententiae, dicta vulgaria, proverbia; cum ipsa, quae in

animo, quae in corpore, quaeque extra.⁹

Vives proceeds to discuss these last three points in great detail.¹⁰ An
explanation for this focus on the loci a persona at the beginning of the
treatise can possibly (and, one might add, at least partly) be found in the
fact that according to Vives the range of deliberative oratory is much
wider than it is described in ancient theory. In the classical sources,
deliberative oratory is generally confined to political matters, that is,
matters related to the polis.¹¹ Quintilian vaguely suggests that other than
political matters can be subject for discussion in deliberative oratory.¹²
Vives states bluntly: “De omnibus quaecunque sunt in nostra potestate
consultamus, de operibus manuum, et actionibus animi.”¹³ He immedi-
atelyr adds that these subjects are treated after consideration of the ambi-
tion and ability to proceed to an action.¹'¹ At this point, the three catego-
ries of credentials, that is, the physical and psychological constitution and
the socia] status and material condition, all three mentioned at the begin-
ning of the treatise, are relevant. Indeed‚ concerning ambition‚ the coun-
sellor must evaluate the possible objective motives to aspire to a physical
or mental action, as well as the possible affective, emotional elements
inssuencing the ambition. Ambition is however limited by the ability to

¹⁰ Ed. Mayansius, 239-40. It is remarkable that Vivcs's discussion of the loci α
persona seems more elaborate than one finds in the classical sources and that, as we
will see, he concentrates in his discussion of the m expetendae on the category of
honestum (ed. Mayansius, 242-43). Compare sor instance Cicero's discussion of the loci

in De inventione, in which more attention is paid to the loci a re than to the loci a
persona (Inv. 1.24.34-25.36, loci a perseum 1.26.37-28.43‚ loci α re).
