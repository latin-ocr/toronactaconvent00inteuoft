The Epistolae Ad

Exercitationem Accommodatae

of Gasparino Barzizza

CHARLES FANTAZZI

Both Erasmus and Vives have commendatory words for Gaspan'no
Barzizza in their discussions of Latin style. Vives is rather niggardly
in his praise, as he rehearses the epistolary style of Latin writers from
antiquity to his own age at the end of his De conscribendis epistolis: “qui
aetate avorum primus coepit in Italia Latine balbutire, Gasparinus; cuius
epistolae vel hac de causa merentur laudem quia in saeculo doctorum pri-
mae,”¹ i.e., the first to be written in the age of the new learning. The
credit for having been the first to revive Latin from semi-barbarism is also
accorded him by other writers of the period, Bartolomeo Fazio and
Marcantonio Sabellico. Fazio said of him in his De viris illustribus: “Gas-
parinus Bergomensis unus est ex iis vel in primis fuit qui consopitam diu
eloquentiam excitaverunt‚'’² and Sabellico thought of him as one who
harked back to a period of elegance before the Gothic storm had swept
over Italy.³

In an early letter⁴ to his friend Cornelis Gerard of Gouda in which he
defends the stylistic precepts of Valla, Erasmus also acknowledges the

eloquence of other Italian writers, naming Aeneas Silvius, Agostino Dan,
