l30 ERASMUS ΟΝ THE EPISTLE To THE ROMANS

in the Annotations: (1) the Annotations reflect an appreciation of the
particularity of each author and book within the Bible as a whole; for
Erasmus, therefore, a “literary reading” included not only stylistic analysis
but also a study of the relation between the human author and his audi—
ence;³ (2) the Annotations grew enormously over the five editions from
1516 to 1535, and ressect growth in Erasmus’ appreciation of the literary
qualities of the Biblical text. Because of Erasmus' appreciation of the
particularity of author and book, it will be fruitful to limit our discussion
here to a single book—the Epistle to the Romans; because of the growth
of the editions, it will be essential to trace developments in Erasmus'
literary analysis from 1516 to 1535. I shall consider first Erasmus’ elucida-
tion of the artistry of the Biblical author in relating to his audience, then
turn to Erasmus‘ analysis of style.

I. The Author and his Audience

From classical times, rhetoricians had taken account of the manner in
which a speaker might win the good will of his audience, and establish his
authority. Erasmus, too, in his Annotations on Romans, undertook to
reveal the art of Paul in establishing his authority, winning the confidence
of his readers and maintaining their good will. He sees the Apostle's skill
particularly in the way in which he works out the tension between his own
Apostolic authority and personal distinction on the one hand, and, on the
other, his readers’ sense of dignity‚ perhaps even their arrogance as
Romans. Already in the first two editions, Erasmus established the central
terms of his analysis. He points almost immediately, at the very beginning
of the book, to elements of ethos, and notes how in Rom. l:l Paul com-
mended himself and his authority: “At once in the very beginning . . . he
wins trust and gains authority'' (“vocatus,'’ 553D [1516]).4 The next note
explicated further the artistry of personal commendation: “He commends
his office with a fine sense of climax, for [he says that] he had not only
been called to perform the service of an Apostle‚ but had been set apart

³ The Annotations also include observations on the author's argument, the logos of
classica] rhetorical theory. Since, in the Annotations on Romans, these observations
are relatively feW, and for the most part seek to clarify the course of the argument
rather than to describe the artistry of the argumentation, I omit further discussion of
them here.
