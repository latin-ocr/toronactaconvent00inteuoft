JOHANN RAMMINGER 589

If this poem had been intended as an appeal for patronage, it would
have been formulated in a remarkably ineffective way. If anything, it
would have the opposite effect. To insult the prospective patron, who here
basically is charged with avarice, would hardly have been an auspicious
beginning for a poet—patron relationship. Neither a Renaissance nor an
ancient sponsor would have cared to receive such an impertinent poem.

But its humorous tone and circular logie prevent us from taking it
literally. The poem fulfills the patron's wish while pretending to deny
it„²⁸ The witty presentation of a hungry poet's thoughts on his art is
much more important than its apparent purpose. The poem presupposes
the amicitia it seems to apply for; but this “friendship” is not the depen-
dent status in the house of a nobleman, but a closer aquaintance on an
equal footing. Τὴε poem cannot be understood as an appeal for help.
Holzel's Maecenas is no more real than Bebel’s hunger or denial of a
poem. Obviously Bebel expects not only the average reader, but also
Holzel to be amused by his “jeux d’esprit.’' We are meant to reg-ard it as
a (rather successful) employment of classical topoi (e.g., a phrase lifted
from Horace, a wordplay from Cicero),²⁴ with which the poet pays his
friend a subtle compliment by giving him a centra] position in the poem
and thus acknowledging his literary interests.

My second example is Bartholini's ode Qui primus ratibus proscidit
aequora, one of the more sophisticated contributions to the collection
(blv-b2v).²⁵ In a grand adaption of the introductory poem to the first
book of Horace's odes he presents himself applying for the patronage of
Holzel. Bartholini defines his goal as a poet by contrasting his profession
with three others. He starts with the most different from his own: the
merchant sailing pen'lous seas in his quest for riches (vv, 1-9). The second
is the soldier, risking his life like the merchant, but with a different aim:
to earn eternal fame through his deeds (vv. 10-15). Similarly lead by the
desire for public recognition, are the participants in athletic and literary
contests, and the court poets praising noblemen (vv, 16-25). Bartholini’s
own life is far removed from these. His companion has been Calliope, the
muse of epic poetry, who despises the rewards of lyrics and avoids the
masses (νν. 26-32). The poet will be content to gain the recognition of his

²⁴ For example, the sames—sama wordplay already occurs in Cic. Att. 1, 16, 5. The
poem may have been inspired by Theocritus, 16 (1 would like to thank Minna Skafte
jensen for the reference).
