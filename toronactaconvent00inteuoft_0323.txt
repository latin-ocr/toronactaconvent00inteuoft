For his preface Sylvanus prefers Latin prose, which may be translated: “1
think 1 can envisage most readers frowning with asnazement on seeing the
maps drawn by me so different from those of my predecessors.'’ On
detail, he mentions north Britain as badly distorted by Ptolemy; and when
we look at his co-ordinates and map, we find that N.E. Scotland goes no
further than 16½· E. of the Canaries, while the Cantium (Kent) promon-
tory reaches 17½· E. Probably the best solution would have been to leave
Ptolemy's co-ordinates in the forms given in good manuscript tradition,
but to add new ones by their side.

Evidently by this time it was felt not only at Venice but also at Nurem-
berg that after over 100 years it was high time Angelus* translation was
revised. Both the 1514 and the 1525 Nuremberg editions complain of it,
Pirckheymer (also called Bfirckhaimer) in the latter claiming that Angelus
was so poor at mathematics that often he did not even understand what
he himself had written. On the other hand he claims that Werner, the
1514 editor, sometimes had hallucinations about the Greek. Pirckheymer’s
own translation seems to have relied on Regiomontanus for any mathe-
matical points. In order to correct one such, an appendix by Regiomon-
tanus was incorporated in the 1525 edition, giving notes on the penulti—
mate chapter of Book VII. One may see the first changes in the opening
words (Geog. i.1): (a) Angelus: Cosmographia designatrix imitatio est totius
cogniti orbis cum his quaesere universaliter sibi iunguntur. The copy of the
Vicenza editio princeps at theJohn Carter Brown Library has, in addition to
other changes in i.1, designatrix crossed out and desig-nationis inserted in
ink after est. (b) Strassburg 1513 edition: Geographia mutatio est per desig-na-
tionem totius cogniti orbis cum his quaesere universaliter sibi iunguntur. (c)
Nuremberg 1514 edition: Geographia imitatio est picturae depraehensae terrae
partis totius cum his quae tamquam ad totum ipsi coniuncta sunt. (d) Pirckhey-
mer, Strassburg, 1525: Geograpkia imitatio est picturae totius partis terrae
cognitae cum iis, quae sibi quasi universaliter sunt annexa. Of these, (b) seems
the best, except that mutatio is inferior for the Greek mimesis and may be
a misreading of the handwriting.

Even Mercator, who can be said to have heralded modern scientific
cartography, was among those who produced a Latin edition of Ptolemy's
Geography.²³ Elegiae verses, addressed to him by Michael ab Isselt Amer-
fordus, imagine God admiring Archimedes’ astronomical sphere and
wondering what He would have thought of Ptolemy's work.
