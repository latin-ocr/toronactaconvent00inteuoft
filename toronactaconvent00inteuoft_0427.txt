17ae Prologues of Comoedia sacra
and Their Classical Models

EMILY KEARNS

Among the writers of Latin biblical and sacred comedy of the 1530s
onwards, there are few who feel reluctance to express the aims and

intentions of their works. Dedicatory letter, accompanying poem, or,
within the play itself, prologue or epilogue: in any or all of these areas of
the play's printed text the author may choose to expound his purpose.
Such passages naturally have a special importance for all those interested
in the theoretical background of this type of classicising writing; but there
are distinctions to be made between these various parts of the text. I have
chosen to centre this short study on the prologue not only because of the

the prologue's relationship with Plautine and particularly Terentian
exemplars—adaptation of classical models being itself a matter of central
theoretical concern—and because of its curious position as both part of the
performance and part of the prefatory material.

In Roman comedy the prologue is spoken directly to the audience,
often out of character, and forms no part of the action. The scholar
Donatus, whose work on comedy was a familiar text by the late fifteenth
century, makes the prologue one of the four essential parts of a comedy,
and distinguishes by their subject-matter four different kinds. We might

put forward something of his own literary theory. This was to be the
formative model for comoedia sacra. That might seem unsurprising, granted
that, in the post-classica] world, it was of course Terence who was both
