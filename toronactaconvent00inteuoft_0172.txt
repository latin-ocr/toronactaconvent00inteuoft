up of common sense and ordinary language.''⁹ Erasmus admits that the
rigid medieval division of letters into salutation‚ exordium, narration, and
conclusion seems n'diculous, but he insists that the letter-writer, like the
orator, can beneflt from the “sure methods and principles'’ of rhetoric (p.
262). Classical models only seem artless, he suggests, citing the example of
Pliny, whose “style is controlled and elaborated with great ingenuity and
retinement, yet it gives the appearance of being effortless, improvised, and
extemporaneous'’ (p. 258). Erasmus seeks support in the literature,
especially Quintilian, in defense of his thesis that letter-writing is an art.
The letter is an all—purpose genre, even more versatile than the oration. If
the writer is to treat many subjects under many circumstances, he must
develop his skills by reading widely in diverse authors and diverse genres.
He must learn rules, but he must exercise good judgment in using them,
considering the purpose he is trying to achieve. He must practice diligent-
ly, but he must not be too sels-conscious. Ultimately, he will become a
good writer only if he follows his own genius, Erasmus is moving toward
the balance of nature, art, and exercise, coupled with eclectic reading and
imitation, that characterizes his mature pedagogy. The Formula contains
the seeds of the De ratione studii, De copia, Opus de conscribendis epistolis, and
Ciceronianus.

Erasmus mentions revising his treatise on letter-writing in letters written
from 2 May 1499 to 27 January 1501.¹⁰ In 1502, he lost his patrons
through 'the deaths of the Bishop of Cambrai and Jacob Batt and the
remarriage of Anna van Borssele, Lady of Veere, for whose son Adolph of
Burgundy the treatise was intended. A preface to a revised version,
addressed to William Blount, Baron Mountjoy, might have been written in
either 1499 or 1509 (ep. 117). Erasmus then makes no further reference
to the work until November 1511 (ep. 241), the period when he was
advising Dean John Colet on the curriculum of St. Paul’s School in Lon-
don and composing textbooks for that new foundation, but we know that
he had continued to revise and expand it after 1501, perhaps for
Mountjoy. By 11 November 1508, when Despauterius completed his
Syntaxis, the Flemish grammarian had seen a draft of the Opus de con—
scribendis epistolis. Despauterius quotes extensively from Section A on the
nature and style of the letter and Section C on formulas of salutation and
valediction, and he alludes to Section B on teaching methods and Section
