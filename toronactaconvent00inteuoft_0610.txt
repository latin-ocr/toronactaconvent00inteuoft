586 HUMANIST POETRY AND ITS CLASSICAL MODELS

to the emperor's or other courts, as stabius phrased it: Qui mihi fautor pius
et patronus: Ι Ι Caesaris qui conciliat fauorem (dlv, vv‚ 33-34).

We may pursue this line of thought a little further. The editor Bo-
nomus himself had a social position at court which was clearly equal, if
not superior to Holzel’s. He was even sent for when Maximilian was dying.
Although he composed poetry, this was only a minor leisure occupatiori
for him. He was not a professional man of letters like, e.g., Bebel or
Celtis. He would not even have been interested in benefitting as a poet
from Holzel's patronage. As the introduction gives us to understand, he
undertook the edition as an act of friendship for the sake of their old
contubernium, when they had both been amanuenses at court (a2‘). In their
friendship poetry was hardly more than a secondary issue.

Hutten’s reference to the famous patrons of antiquity recommended a
norm for the behaviour of a patron. But the ancient model had another,
equally important function. It served as a literary standard for poetical
descriptions of cases of patronage. As such it determined the literary
profile of Holzel's sponsorship to a large extent.

The term “maecenas'‘ refers to the most prominent literary patron in
antiquity‚¹⁷ who gave his name to this type of sponsor: C. Cilnius Maece-
nas, the patron of Horace, Vergil and other poets of Rome's Golden
Age.18 Our poems frequently invoke him and other sponsors known
from classical literature. Individual poet-patron relationships varied as
widely in antiquity as in the Renaissance, but the essential points of
ancient literary patronage can be briefly outlined as follows.¹⁹ The basic
framework for personal services and obligations was the concept of

¹⁷ In speaking of “patronage in antiquity” I refer to a span of time beginning with
Catullus (i.e., the middle of the first century B.C.), and ending with Martial and
Juvenal in the middle of the second century A.D. Earlier cases of literary patronage
are not sufficiently well documented to influence the picture Renaissance poets had
of ancient patronage. Later poetry remained without importance in that respect
because of the changes Roman literary production underwent; also the Renaissance
held it in low esteem (e.g.,Joachim Vadianus‚ De poetica et carminis ratione, ed. Peter

Schfiffer, I [Miinchem 1973], 50-51. The De poetica was first published in 1518).

¹⁸ The way Horace presents his relationship to Maecenas in his poems reflects the
development of the relationship itself. See Eckard Lefevre‚ “Horaz und Maecenas,‘’ in
ANRW, 31, 3 (Berlin s New York, 1981), 1987-20293 Gordon Williams, Tradition and
Originality in Roman Poetvy (Oxford, 1968), 44-51.
