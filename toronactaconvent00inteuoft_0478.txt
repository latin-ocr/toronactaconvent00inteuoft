454 CATULLAN NEo-LATIN POETRY

(1453-1500), the most important imitator of Catullus in the fifteenth
century next to Pontano‚ is known to have been a younger friend of
Pontano at Naples. Not later than 1489, when he came to Florence, he
must also have known Landino's poems. He published at Rome in 1489
two and at Florence 1497 two further Libri epigrammaton, which again
show various metres, hendecasyllabics included. Some poems show the
typical stylistic elements of Catullus. Marullo also took specific Catullan
poems as models, some not yet used by Pontano. But, contrary to Ponta-
no, Catullus is not the declared and not the most prominent poetical
model, and love is only one of several themes. Above all, there is a deci-
sive difference between the love poems of Marullo and Pontano: Marullo
praises the beauty of Neaera, assures her of his unchangeable love,
complains about her refusals, confesses his torments and accuses Amor of
cruelty, but he never describes the happy pleasures of love, not even in his
desires. Only once he uses the Catullan term basiationes—but he presses his
hundred kisses on a picture of his beloved. In Pontano’s Liber Partheno-
paeus kisses were a dominant motive‚ and he showed his readers the love
play up to and after the climax. Marullo is very conscious of this contrast
to Pontano. He explains and defends his position in a poem to an un-
known Quintilianus-there are reasons to suppose that this is a pseudonym
for his poetry teacher Iovianus Pomanus. Quintilianus had censured Marul-
lo's liber as nimium castus . . . nimiumque pudicuS, but approved of his
ingenium. According to the often quoted c. 16 of Catullus, he apparently
even wanted from a poeta castus et pius the writing of versus molliculi et
parum pudici. Marullo, on the contrary, was in favour of carmina casta: they
please Apollo and the Muses and as, he says, vetat ingenuus verba inhonesta
pudor. The reference to Catullus does not bring him to compose obscene
poems: Tu licet Mars-umque seras doctumque Catullumset quoscumque alios
Martia Roma legit] non tamen efficies, ut Phrynae scribere malim . . . s Sit procul
a nobis obscoena licentia scripti: s ludimus innocuae carmina mentis opus. And in
accordance with his own poetical practice, he lists the permitted themes of
love poetry: Sit satis auratos crines laudare Neaerae, s sit satis in duram multa
queri dominam s et facere iratum saevo convincia Amori, l . . . caetera Thespiadum
prohibet chorus. The imitation of Catullus in the sense of Pontano was not
permissible. Landino probably approved. The Carmelite Baptista Mantuanus
condemned at the same time in an elegy Contra poetas impudice loquentes any
erotic poetry: in his view casta carmina were exclusively destined ad sanctos
usus. The distinction between the poet’s life and poems was wrong.

It is remarkable that, just at the end of the eighties of the fifteenth
century, Pontano returned to his Catullan poetry: between 1489 and 1501,
he composed two books entitled Hendecasyllabi, the first poem books of
