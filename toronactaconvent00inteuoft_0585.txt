MARIANNE PADE 561

More often than not a translation would be dedicated to somebody. ln
the Renaissance, Plutarch's Lives os Famous Greeks and Romans were
considered a wonderful collection of “mirrors for princes,'’ and they were
incessantly sent with dedications to secular and ecclesiastical magnates.
Guarino apart‚ only a few dedicated their Latin Lives to other humanists:
Leonardo Bruni sent Latin Vitae to Coluccio Salutau' and Antonio Loschi;
Francesco Barbaro dedicated the Aristides arrd Cato to his brother Zac-
charias; and Antonio Beccaria sent the pair Alcibiades and Coriolanus to the
physician Matteolo Perugini. A few Lives have no dedications: most of
these were made by Iacopo Angeli da Scarperia, Leonardo Bruni and
Guarino, and they were completed in the first quarter of the fifteenth
century.⁶

Guarino translated thirteen different Lives and some Comparationes. He
made several revisions of his own translations, usually, it seems, when he
had found a worthy dedicatee. The first was the Lise os Alexander which
Guarino undertook while studying with Manuel Chrysoloras in Constanti·
nople from 1403 to 1408, but he probably made a revision of it in 1412
when it was published together with the Caesar. During the years Guarino
taught in Florence (1411 to 1414), he further completed three Roman
Lives of famous republican heroes: the Flaminius, Marcellus, and Coriolanus.
The next five years of his life Guarino spent teaching Greek and Latin in
Venice, and there he translated six Greek Lives: the Dion, Pelopidas,
Themistocles, Phocion, Eumenes, and Philopoemen. Finally, he presented
Leonello d'Este with the pair Lysander and Sulla on the occasion of his
wedding in 1435.

Of these translations, only the Coriolanus and Eumenes lack dedications.
It seems, however, that only half of them were undertaken with one
particular dedicatee in mind; the rest were published with dedications
several years after they were completed, although this is not always clear
from the accompanying letters. Undoubtedly many of them were originally
made for teaching purposes, and so they would be literal versions with no
pretensions to stylistic elegance. They would serve as a help to Guarino's
students to read the Greek original. Such a version would have to be
revised before it was published. When the dedication was thus written
years after the translation, it will not necessarily reflect interest which
Guarino originally had in the Greek text.
