148 ERASMUS’ opus οε CONSCRIBENDIS EPISTOLIS

Jolidon compares the authorized edition of 1522 with the pirated
Libellus written, he argues, in 1499. Focusing especially on style, he
concludes that in revising his early draft, Erasmus shows himself more
sober and circumspect as a result of controversy, purifies his style of
medievalisms, and enriches his expression. Jolidon’s argument that
Siberch published the Encomium matrimonii in the Libellus from Erasmus’
early draft of his treatise on letter-writing, not from Martens' 1518 Decla-
mationes aliquot Erasmi Roterodami, has convinced Jean-Claude Margolin.²
In an important note, Jolidon dates the composition of the pirated Famula
after the Libellus, “de 1500 environ, en raison d'une allusion a l'incredibilis
nitor’ des lettres de Politien (cf, la dedicace des ‘Adagiorum collectanea’ a
Mountjoy‚ lettre n‘ 126 de juin 1500, l. 133), de l’absence complete de la
locution NEC . . . QUIDEM, si frequente dans ‘l'edition Siberch, et plus
generalement de la totale independance de cette derniere edition (qui
ignore Politien) par rapport a la ‘Formula’ ’' (p. 583 n. l). These sugges-
tions challenge the conclusions ofJames D. Tracy,Jolidon’s predecessor
in the study of Erasmus' intellectual development.³

In a subsequent presentation to the Fifth International Congress of
Neo-Latin Studies (St. Andrews, 24 August to l September 1982), also
published in the Acta,Jolidon reviews internal and external evidence in an
effort to solve certain problems concerning the composition, contents,
and publication history of the Formula, “un des textes les plus enigmati-
ques de l'illustre Rotterdamois.’'‘¹ Here he abandons his suggestion that
the Formula postdates the Libellus for the more common view that it stems
from the first draft of Erasmus' treatise.Jolidon notes that Erasmus cites
the Epistolimaioi charakteres attributed to Libanius but will not admit that
this reference establishes a terminus post quem for the composition of the
Formula, proposing instead that Erasmus saw it in manuscript (p. 240 n.
8). The editio princeps of pseudo-Libanius was published not, as Jolidon
