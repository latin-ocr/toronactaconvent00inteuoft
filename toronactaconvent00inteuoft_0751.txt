brecht. Indeed, in Borch’s poem Albrecht is the great and awful example
of a Swedish king who suffers well-deserved defeat at the hands of Den—
mark. In his dream, Charles is warned, not only by the appearance of
Gustav Adolf, but also by the Swedish saint, the holy Birgitm, who lived in
the fourteenth century and was a contemporary of Albrecht. She addresses
him thus (Anmg. 157): semialberte . . . nimium fremis-Albertus being the
Latin form of Albrecht. This is likely to be an allusion to Laetus’ Margaretica,
where Albrecht’s fremituS, his blustering behaviour, is a continuous theme.
The first words of Margaretica actually are: Alberti Sueonum fremitus . . .
canimus, and the last: Alberti fremitus fatali in sede quieuit. In Borch's poem
Charles is a new Albrecht, that is, yet another boastful Swedish king who
finally suffers a crushing and deserved defeat to Denmark.

Margaret's dream in Laetus’ poem and Charles’ dream in Borch’s poem
function in much the same way. In both poems the dream is an attempt
to persuade the principal character with the help of historical examples of
Swedish crimes and defeats. Margaret is encouraged in her dream to take
up the fight against the Swedes, as her deceased husband not only de-
scribes to her the future Union of Kalmar, but also reminds her of earlier
Swedish crimes which must now be punished. Charles is warned, in his
dream, against the war with Denmark: First‚ saint Birgitta tells him about
his coming defeat and death (in 1660), then he sees a former enemy, the
duke of Kurland,* call forth the punishment of the gods upon him, and
finally the ominous figure of Gustav appears. Unlike Margaret, Charles
does not obey the divine advice given in the dream, and continues the war
with Denmark in spite of the warning.

For the reader‚however, these dreams also point beyond the plot itself.
The battle is placed in a greater historical perspective: In both dreams the
battle is portrayed as a consequence of Sweden's previous crimes, and in
turn, a number of later Swedish defeats are presented as consequences of
precisely this battle. It is one of the characteristic features of classical
historical epics that the subject is placed in a historical perspective
through various forms of prophecies and accounts of previous histo-
ry—thus appearing as an event of particular significance in the history of
the nation. Laetus and Borch have borrowed this feature in their dream
scenes, and given it a polemical turn by limiting their account to a series
of historica] Swedish crimes and defeats and Danish triumphs.

Another traditional epic characteristic that lends the subject of the

jacob of Kurland, and taken him prisoner.
