described as an “ingenti praelio,” is “atque ambiguo” (460). Α Spanish
victory is presented as a lesser defeat—“magna utriusque gentis strage, sed,
quod res indicat, Gallorum maiore” (459)—and, in another case, victory is
viewed as an ephemeral passage into defeat: “Pugnatum . . . ingenti et
cruento praelio: Galli quidem victores, sed ita accisi ut coacti sint Italia
decedere.'’ Phrases such as “non sine periculo'' (458), “in medio fortunae
belli’' (458) and “gravi bello'’ (459) neutralize the polarity victory] defeat.

Vives also inverts the civilizations barbarism topic. Itis, he claims, Chiis-
tians who most often use artillery, so that the Turks are forced—“coacti'’—
to use these new military machines to defend themselves. Related to the
inversion of moral antitheses is the reversal of the polarity pagan] Chris·
tian. Tiresias exclaims to the nominally Christian Basilius at one point:
“Hoc ego scio gentilis, tu ignoras Christianus?'’ (471). Basilius responds,
“Ista Christiana? Audis, Tiresia?’' (471).

In the inverted language-world of the De dissidiis, agent of destruction
and victim are identified. “Suffer” and “inflict,” for example, become
nearly interchangeable terms in Vives’s description of the imperial troops
bottled up at Ticino: “maxima fuisset vel accepta ab eis clades, conclusis
et fugientibus, vel certe data a desperatis’‘ (461). Likewise, armies “dant
damna atrocissima, et accipiunt'' (474). This identity of agent and victim
ultimately fuses the “other'' with the self: “Periculum adit, qui facit’' (461),
Tiresias states at one point. He later confirms this conflation with the
sententia, “Qui ad se Martem accersit canem rabidam, fieri secus non
potest quin mordeatur’' (462). Tiresias, finally, refers to the bands of
strife-torn Europe as agents of sels-destruction: “Dic uno verbo, hostem
esse quemque sibi ipsi'’ (456).

The openness of the De dissidiis is also a function of characterization.
Seemingly autonomous speakers guide the development of the dialogue.
Osten Minos, the impartial judge of the Underworld, directs the dialogue
by means of stylistic observations: “Satis es prooemiatus, narra tandem'’
(453); “dic paucis'' (479); “exspecta finem colloquii” (471). The judge, how·
ever, does not mandate either during the dialogue or at the end, any single
solution, but praises Polypragmon for the impartiality of his narration of
European affairs benneen 1445 and the early sixteenth century (48).

The universalizing viewpoint of the speakers, typical of Lucian's dialogues,
serves in De dissidiis to satirize the national and dynastic aspirations presented
by Polypragmon. The power plays between France, Spain, and Italy are
described as child’s play. War is referred to as a “brevi comoediae'’ (458).
Vives’s reduction of heroic action to fate and his insistence that history is not
defined at any point—the incursion of Charles VIII into Italy closes with the
king’s untimely death and the loss of the conquered territory (458); Navarre
