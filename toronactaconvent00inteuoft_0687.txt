Milton with Vossius indicates that OsEducation is much less original than
appears if studied only in light of purely English settings of the 1640s.¹⁰
However, the proper context for trying to view Milton’s educational
program is not that of broader humanist thought generally, as many
assert,¹¹ but specifically that of the late cinquecento‚ in which the tenden-
cy to link poetics with the moral sciences becomes marked.¹² Secondly,
this is evidently an orientation that Milton shares with thoroughly Re-
formed Neo-Latin thought obtaining in influentia] intellectual circles on
the continent rather than with “Pun‘tan” viewpoints predominating in
Britain at the start of the revolution. Thirdly‚ both Vossius and Milton
seem to reflect an important shift away from the outmoded trivium and
quadrivium, certainly as Milton saw them. To speak, as does the commen-
tary to the Yale Complete Prose Wonks of “the trivium‚'' as standing “at the
beginning and end of Milton's whole program'’ (PW, 194-95) distorts the
picture.¹³ While the statement is not very helpful because it literally
holds true for almost any educan'onal scheme, whether ancient or modern,
this formulation makes the English poet seem far more old-fashioned than
1 think he really is. Quite unlike John Donne, who lamented all the “co-
haerence” lost half a generation before, Milton does not flinch before the
“Baconian”¹⁴—should we not rather read “Hellenist'’ here?—challenge of
the “new” science to old learning. As Professor Dibon has indicated,¹⁵
there was a revolution in Protestant university education on the continent
at the end of the sixteenth century. Vossius but codifies this change, in my
opinion, and Milton embraces it with gusto. Moreover, the English revo—
lutionary‘s preference throughout is always for “operative” sciences, never
“speculative’‘ ones, like metaphysics‚ that great stumbling block for even
the most enlightened of Reformed universities. Unlike Vossius, who at
least acknowledges existence of the field <A 69⁵8, III.ii.7; V.iv.7-12), Milton
ignores metaphysics completely, and this fact (not to speak of his dislike
