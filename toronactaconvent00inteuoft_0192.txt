168 THE JEPHTHAH TRAGEmEs

seems, we witness a kind of disconnection between father and daughter.
In his drama these two characters are human beings in their own right,
one of whom, Iphis, finds herself eventually playing the part of the Redeem-
er, whereas the other, Jephthah, must fulfil the role of the tragic hero in the
Greek sense of the term. To realize this cast, the poet deemed it necessary
for Iphis to undergo first, as it were, a tmnssexual metamorphosis.

Jephthah is a noble hero, who has made an error by taking the νοω, his
ἁμαρτῖα, who then clings obstinately to his conviction that he must carry
out what he has promised, i.e., his ἄτη, and so goes to ruin. Jephthah's
ἀτη, his blindness, comes out clearest in the longest and central episode
of the play: the debate with the sacerdos. Like the rest, this piece is very
well organizedzjephthah speaks the first and the final words, but it is the
priest who holds the floor: 158 lines against 56 forJephthah. The episode
has five partS, each of which contains a specific argument. In the first we
are confronted with the problem of man’s freedom to refrain from
sinning‚ or rather with the lack of freedom to commit gruesome deeds
such asJephthah is about to commit, deeds forbidden by natural laW, by
true piety and by God the Father. The second part contains an altercatio
between the priest and Jephthah on the question whether vows and
sacrifices are permitted, or even obligatory. Jephthah upholds an ethics
based on intentions: good intentions are to express themselves in a strict
observation of the letter of biblical precepts and examples. In the third
section the sacerdos unfolds a view of the Bible as a moral law which serves
as a guideline for our decisions (“a lamp to my feet”, Psalms 119:105). But
it is a law that will on no account grant a licence for cruelty‚ stupidity and
error, which may come in the wake of human ordinances. In the fourth
division jephthah's attitude and problem are placed in the socio-political
context of ignorant people that ssatter tyrants and extol their crimes. One
feature of this ignorance is to cling blindly to a dogma once it has been
adopted. The fifth part is a peroration, in which both points of view are
summed up. The pn‘est contends: “You [he employs the plural vosl] close
your eyes to the light of truth [lumen veritatis] and try to win a reputation
from your crimes with resounding slogans; moral laws are of the same
kind as natural laws; they cannot be changed by men.’' And Jephthah
“prefers the absurd and simple truth to specious but godless wisdom.”

1 venture to suggest that we should regard the viewpoint and arguments
presented by the priest as those of Buchanan himself. They contain in a
nutshell a modern biblical-humanistic ethics with strong Erasmian accents,
which also has much in common with protestant views then in vogue.⁵ In
