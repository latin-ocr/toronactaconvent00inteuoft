186 LEARNED SCANDINAVIAN WOMEN

unreasonable to exclude completely from any kind of learning those
who have taken it upon themselves to translate and rework books in
their own native language, or have written their own independent
commentaries to something in Danish. They are, in fact, all famous
for their writings, even though they have not acquired the basic
learning which you require. Therefore, their persistency, to the
extent that it is connected with even just a little education, should
definitely be pointed out to posterity, since it is no little praise that
is due them who lend support as second and third in line.¹⁷

Thus, Sperling knows what is normally understood to be a learned wom-
an, and that he himself is extending the notion of learning. It was logical
to do this if one looked at the possibilities available to women for stimulat-
ing the intellect at all. It was also in the spin't of the time to recognize the
value of cultural transmission in the mother tongue in the form of transla-
tions, poetry, and scholarship.

In the subsequent gynaecea Otto Sperling’s view was the one to prevail.
Albert Thura went through similar considerations. He expresses a certain
degree of concern regarding the organization of his maten'al. He writes in
the preface that he has considered separating the women in his gynaeceum
into two chambers‚ one for the very learned and one for the less learned.
He does not mention which criteria he would employ in order to under-
take such a division, but points out the risk involved in placing someone
incorrectly, i.e.‚ placing a learned person together with the half-learned or
the reverse. The lack of information about them and the modesty of the
learned involves a risk he does not dare to run. He chooses the diplomatic
solution and lets them occupy the same room.

In the work itself‚ sixteen are mentioned of whom he maintains that
they know Latin. Four more are descn'bed without use of the word Latin,
in wording that indicates that he thought they knew this language. Con-
cerning eight of those who were familiar with Latin he notes that they also
knew Greek, or had tried to learn it. And one also knew HebreW, we are
told. From another source we know that at least one more knew Hebrew.

¹⁷ “Iam vero et in Danica lingva sola eruditionem praestare possumus, et in quavis
lingva: ita ut illas (illis ms.), quae vertendis et in suam lingvam transferendis libris
operatae, aut suo ingenio aliqvid commentatae sunt, in Danica lingva, ab eruditione
omni penitus excludere nequaquam liceat. Sunt enim scn'ptis clarae omnes, licet
solidam eruditionem illam, qvam tu postulas, non assecuta sint: ideoque illarum
industria, utpote cum eruditione aliqva conjuncta, maxime est laudanda posteris, et
magni facienda3 cum in secundis et tertiis etiam subsistere laus non minima sit.” (ibid.)
