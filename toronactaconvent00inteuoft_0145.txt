filii sibi dilecti, explaining that the phrase found in the Vulgate reproduced
a Hebrew idiom (LB V1 884D). At 1:20 he replaced a dangling participle
with an ablative absolute, “or else the phrase will not be free of solecism;
for one cannot speak in Latin . . . as the Greeks do” (ibidem, 886C). In
chapter 2 he queried the phrase triumphans illos (the Vulgate version at
Col. 2:15). Normally a different construction was used with the verb
triumphare. “There are some people who are bothered by the phrase
triumphans illos because it is not quite Latin; to be sure, Virgil said trium·
phalas gentes, nor is this mode of expression rare in historiographers.
Triumphare foeminam is rather unusual, however, although it can be found
in Trebellius Pollio” (ibidem, 89013). Similarly he replaced the phrase nolite
mentiri invicem by ne mentiamini alius adversus alium at Col. 3:9, correcting
the unidiomatic expression.

It would appear from these examples that Erasmus adopted the gram-
matical rules and vocabulary commonly found in classical prose authors,
shying away from idiosyncrasies and poetic licence. Moreover‚ he seems to
limit probati autores to the golden period of Latin literature, rejecting both
archaic and Christian authors, and giving a reluctant hearing to authors
like Pliny and Suetonius. No doubt his governing principle was claritas.
This was best served by following the common usage of mainstream
authors whose expressions were familiar to readers and would therefore
be readily understood.

To return to Masson’s description of the pedant: the Louvain theolo-
gian exaggerated Erasmus' predilections in the tradition of polemic
literature. His portrait of the pedant is a caricature. The real Erasmus was
more flexible than Masson's doctrinaire arbiter of style. He did advocate
a return to classical usage wherever feasible, but was prepared to concede
to theologians their idiom proper. Thus he accepted certain expressions
that had become entrenched by tradition as biblical termini technici. There
was no reason, however, to absolve the biblical translator from all obliga-
tion to observe classica} norms of speech, thereby forcing scholarly readers
to lower their standards. It was better for others to raise their sights and
learn correct Latin. Of course there was reluctance among established
theologians to admit “that they must give up as old men what they had
learned as smooth-cheeked youngsters‚” but such reluctance must be
overcome. It was better to learn late than never: An praestat nescire quod
cognitu necessarium est, quam serius discere?¹⁵
