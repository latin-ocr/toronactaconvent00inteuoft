94 PUNs, PARADOXES, AND HEURISTIC INQUIRY

in fact, in Western Europe. And the nature of these bonds repeatedly
invites questions about justice and equity, the very issues that connect
Books I and II of the Utopia and are essential to the Utopian form as
More has created it.

Suicide (or quasi-suicide), for instance, leads to a reflection upon the
relationship between the body and soul and self and other before and
after death, while marriage, the pri mary social relationship in Utopia, even
etymologically is a conjugium or yoking. Similarly, a number of Utopian
practices ressect that country’s belief that public officials are (or should be)
the servants of their country, in the service of their fellow citizens, else-
where often just a pious hope. Like marriage, laws bind, and Hythlo-
daeus's discourse invites a consideration of fairness and plays etymologic-
ally upon the root for tying while it advances Utopia’s attack upon West-
ern European laws: “They themselves think it most unfair [iniquissimum]
that any group of men should be bound [obligari] by laws which are either
too numerous to be read through or too obscure to be understood by
anyone” (195s11-14). Finally, the discussion of treaties invites reflection
upon those things that bind one country to another and how and why
those bonds (really contracts) are broken, matters of immediate relevance
to More, other humanists, and all of Europe in and around 1516.⁹ Thus
Raphael Hythlodaeus’s almost invariably dead-pan commentary opens up
some of the most serious issues any society faces, even when it answers (or
purports to answer) them. And it indirectly reveals the degree to which we
could see Hythlodaeus as a gymnosophist and Thomas More, himself, as
a Socratic gadfly who amuses, perplexes, and disquiets by turn, but never
lets us forget the fundamental question he is putting before us: justice and
injustice in the commonwealth.

No longer can we read the text simply mimetically, then. Rather, we
find a series of joco-serious case studies that we are invited to deconstruct
and reconstruct, often simultaneously. Obviously I cannot treat all these
cases here. Let me focus, then, on the problem of the serui, since this is a
patent crux and Hythlodaeus’s point of departure. He starts boldly,
naming four very different groups that constitute the serui or bondsper-
sons of Utopia: prisoners of war, limited to those who were captured in
wars that the Utopians themselves fought3¹⁰ Utopian inhabitants who
