ed,¹³ at the urging of a great man who presided over a church dedicated
to St. Michael.¹⁴ They were probably intended to be put up near images
of the angels in the church, as the wording of the last poem suggests;¹⁵
but, though Erasmus tempered his style so as to bring thern closer to
prose, the great man rejected them because he found them to be so poetic
as to seem like Greek.¹⁶ The presence of these poems near images of the
angels at mass on angelic feastdays is suggested by a reference to the
incense of High Mass.¹⁷ Finally‚ in 1523 Erasmus wrote and published
separately his mass for the Virgin of Loreto, including a poetic introit and
sequence. It had been written at the request of Thiebaut Bietry, parish
priest at Porrentruy, and was indulgenced by the archbishop of Besancon
for use within his diocese so that it became an actual part of the liturgy.

If we compare these poems with their medieval sources and analogues,
we see Erasmus is more selective in the episodes he includes than some of
his medieval predecessors. He ignores the legend of St. Ann as the mother
of all three New Testament Marys¹⁸ and focuses on the vivid episode of
the high pn'est's rejection of Ann and Joachim from the temple and the
appearance of the angel to them. Omitting all but one of the many
miracles attributed to Gregory in Legenda Aurea¹⁹ and some medieval
hymns,²⁰ he recounts only how a column of light revealed Gregory when
he had fled to the woods to avoid becoming pope; his humility made him
suitable for the highest office. After a brief mention of Gabriel’s appear-
ances to Daniel and Zachary, Erasmus limits himself to the annunciadon,
omitting many other messages sometimes included in medieval hymns,
such as informing Joseph that Mary was not adulterous, telling the shep-
herds of Christ's birth, warningJoseph to flee into Egypt and the magi not
