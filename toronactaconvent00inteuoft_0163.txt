CHARLES PANTAZZI 145

In another missive we learn of a very young man elected to leadership in
his republic against the mos maiorum because of his outstanding courage
(Furietti, p. 271). There are very few strictly anecdotal letters, notably one
that tells of highwaymen in Tuscany who captured a traveler but then let
him go with provisions for the road because of his wit and good character,
illustrating that sometimes thieves are more honorable than law-abiding
citizens (Furietti‚ p. 270).

The subject turns to the praise of religion in four pairs of letters, its
importance for ensuring the greatness of ancient Rome and its necessity
together with philosophy and letters to achieve a tranquil and full life, but,
the writer counsels, better no religion than an inert‚ apathetic kind, which
is more equivalent to sacrilege. Another letter draws its inspiration from
a reading of St. Basil on divine worship (Fun‘etti, p. 286).

The theme of personal integrity pervades many of the letters, such as
the inability to suffer infringement of one‘s honour with equanimity, or to
reap hatred in return for good deeds. Mixed in with these discussions of
lofty sentiments are other more practical reports on financial matters, the
conduct of court cases and the management of estates, as one finds also
in Cicero and Pliny.

A series of letters towards the end of the collection treat of the respect
owed to aging parents and of the bitterness of old age. Many of the latter
type are very despondent in tone, which elicit in the answers an attempt
at epistolary consolation. In one the writer laments that he has been
reduced to a worse state than his enemies could ever have imagined or
hoped for. Another is ready to offer his throat to the executioner. Advice
of various kinds is given. In one instance the respondent urges that the
aggrieved man leave the company of men and withdraw from material
things so that he will return lightened of his burdens. Another counsellor
quotes a phrase from a letter of Cicero to Atticus (11.12.4); “stabis animo
erecto et perferendo vinces fortunam’' (Fun'etti, p. 326). The very last
letter of the collection, as we have it, refers once again to the sacredness
of friendship, which must rise above all personal advantage and pleasure.
The writer in this case—and perhaps Barzizza purposely closes on this
note—does not claim to be numbered among his correspondent’s friends
and yet promises his help, prepared to come to his defense, which his
friends have villainously abandoned.

With this general idea of the content of the model letters we may
attempt some cursory description of the Latin style used in them. Barzizza
was known to his contemporaries as a champion and apostle of Ci-
ceronian style. 1t was to him that Bishop Gerardo Landriani had entrusted
the transcription of the manuscripts of the De oratore, the Orator and the
