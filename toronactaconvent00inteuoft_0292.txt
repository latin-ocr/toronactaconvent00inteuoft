the length and width of this sea and have discovered nothing unusual in
it except the sharp rocks which are deadly to voyagers in the area of
Hyrcania. And finally, we ourselves, the members of the Swedish Embassy
to the Shah of Persia, come forward as witnesses who, having been tossed
on this basin by changing winds for twelve days without sails and oars,
discovered no whirlpools and, after skillful interrogation, discovered not
one eyewitness among the neighboring peoples. Therefore, are all the
many writers who report about them lying? They certainly arel In this
region of the world, some men have a certain reserve and desire to please
with the result that they always answer yes to questions; still other men
have a certain peevishness so that, when annoyed with unclear speakers,
they extricate themselves the more easily by affirming, when questioned,
that which they do not understand or do not know. Consequently, with
the same trust and ease with which travelers receive instructions from the
local camel riders, barbarians and ignorant people‚ they again credulously
expound to their readers the notions they have accepted.

Among the most recent assertors of whirlpools, the Reverend Father
Avril, a Frenchman, deserves to be mentioned. In book two of his Voyages
written in French, as he attempts to demonstrate the effluvium of the
Caspian into the Persian Gulf, he posits two whirlpools around the Hyrca-
nian shore which absorb the sea with a dreadful tumult and crash but
which he himself did not see. In an effort to bolster his contention, he
says that leaves of the Salvia, which grow nowhere else but on the shores
of the Caspian Sea, float during autumn in the Persian Gulf after they
have been snatched up by the aforementioned whirlpools and carried
through a subterranean channel. A specious argumenti 1 did indeed
perspire for two years on the shores of the Persian Gulf while sedulously
examining its entire history, to the extent of my ability. But I would be
lying if I said that I have ever seen a Salvia leaf among the vegetation
which happens to float in or is tossed up by the waters‚ or is drawn out in
the nets of the fishermen. The gulf nourishes Alga not Salvia and during
the summer deposits an abundance of it on the shore. Perhaps the rever-
end father’s informant, whose Latin was shaky and who was misled by the
similar sound, substituted Salvia for Alga. Or perhaps the reverend father
erred in taking the leaves of the Horau fruit, mixed with Alga, for the
leaves of the Salvia Major whose shape and size they resemble, but whose
wrinkles and other qualities, however, are different. This plant (which I
will describe below) grows luxuriantly in the manner and size of Salix in
depressed parts of islands and on the uliginous shore. At certain hours of
the day it is constantly shaken by the incoming tide of the sea. The leaves,
which are bent downward, and often the stems themselves are snatched
