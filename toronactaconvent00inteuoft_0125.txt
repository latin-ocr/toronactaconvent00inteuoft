Harpsfield Erasmus’ letter is used as an obvious source. . . .²⁶

As for More: about 1506—0r as Sylvester reckons, 1510—More wrote his
Lise os Pico, which, Richard Sylvester wrote, “indirectly inherits the Sueto·
nius method, which had been followed by Paulinus in his Life os Ambmse
and by Einhardus in his LtJse os Charlemagroe.”²⁷ Further, More adapted
one of Suetonius' tales about Tiberius in his 1509 coronation poems to
Henry VIII. Richard III, Sylvester argues most convincingly, follows or
adapts Suetonius, Sallust, and Tacitus.²⁸ But let us pick up the clue in
Erasmus’ 1519 letter to Hutten where he tells us that More worked hard
in his middle years to polish his prose: per omne scripti genus stilum exer-
cens.²⁹ The classical models were there to be followed for the writing of
the lives of Pico and Richard—Plutarch, Sallust, Suetonius, Tacitus—but we
cannot say what editions he used, or what commentaries he knew. But we
can echo Sylvester’s words: “he borrowed from everyone,'’ and “his Latin
words are tesselated with words or phrases from a variety of authors.'’³⁰

To conclude: it is premature to offer a firm conclusion to what is
avowedly a provisional study. 1 intend to spend some of my time in
Europe during the next two or three years reading more prefaces (a
number of which 1 intend to collect and put together), and above all to
look more closely at the commentaries on the classical writers of biogra-
phy that have been cited. In writing on Medieval Aspects os Renaissanoe
Learning, Paul O. Kristeller has spoken of the central importance of the
commentary among the literary genres for scholarly literature of the late
Middle Ages: textbook‚ commentary, quaestio, and treatise. “The com-
mentary,” he concludes, “should probably be considered as the most
important form of scholarly literature of the Middle Ages.'’³¹ That evalu-

³⁰ Sylvester, loc. cit„ p. boodii. Tmelatod was one of Dick Sylvester’ s favorite words,
and he would have relished the fact that one of the citations in the Oxsord Latin
Dictionary (1982) is from Suetonius’ Julius, 46: tesellata pauimenta—thas is, constructed
from or adorned with mosaic work.
