Guarino's Dedicatory Letters

A. Stmcture

Guarino hardly ever dedicated his Latin Lives to anybody he did not
know fairly well. One exception to this seems to be the Alexander and
Caesar, which were probably presented to a North Italian prince around
1412.⁷ The rest were dedicated to influential people in the cities where he
lived, to other humanists, close friends and pupils. In a number of instan-
ces several of these functions were united in the same person. In his
prefaces one finds all the traditional loci, but in varying order and not
always with the same emphasis. Their use seems to be determined by
Guarino’s relationship to the dedicatee and by the occasion of the dedica-
tion rather than by the nature of the work in question. The style of the
dedications changes over the years; in the early ones there is usually a very
factual description of why the translation was undertaken, while later on
Guarino would begin the letter with a small moral or philosophie essay
which would lead elegantly to the actual dedication. In his first prefaces
Guarino would write about matters pertaining to method of translation, but
this theme afterwards disappears entirely. In later years he omits to ask the
recipient to be the judge of the translation, which surely reflects the growing
esteem in which Guarino was held. Only once, in his very first translation,
the Ad Demonicum of Pseudo-Isocrates, does he explicitly say that the work
was undertaken at the request of the dedicatee, Floro Valier.⁸

In the early years, Guarino adheres closely to the traditional formal
structure, and his prefaces are with few exceptions built up in a uniform
manner. In 1411 he sent the Lise of Flaminius to the Florentine noble
Roberto de'Rossi. Guarino’s choice of text is extremely important, but this
cannot be seen from the preface. Flaminius was the great Roman phil·
hellene, and Rossi would have been flattered by the association, since he
had been one of the early admirers of Manuel Chrysoloras and instrumen-
tal in inviting him to Florence. In the preface Guarino first tells why he
translated the life. Unexpectedly he had had some time free, and there
was no better way to use it than to undertake a translation. The result
would please others and the work itself was a healthy intellectual exercise.
Guarino sent the translation to Rossi because he was well educated in
both Greek and Latin.⁹ Then follows a eulogy of Rossi's achievements as
