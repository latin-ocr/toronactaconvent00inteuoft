WILLIAM BARKER 203

He was born in Foru in 1530, studied at Bologna and padua, and worked
as a physician and teacher. He wrote many books—on the nursing of
children, skin diseases, diseases of women, and so on—as well as commen-
taries and lectures. He was a successful practitioner. From 1562 to 1569
he was physician to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, to whom he dedicated
the first edition of the De arte gymnastico. He became very famous in 1573
when he cured Maximilian II from a deadly illness. That same year he also
rededicated the De arte gymnastica, now in a second illustrated edition, to
the emperor. In later years he taught in Bologna and in Pisa; he died in
1606, a celebrated practitioner and an important humanist scholar of
medicine.

Mercuriale’s treatise is almost entirely concerned with ancient sport,
“exercitationum omnium vetustarum genera’' as the title page emphasizes,
and is an extraordinarily well-documented survey of the Greek and Latin
sources for the study of physical exercise. The first book treats of defini-
tions and of the early history of gymnastics, goes on to discuss the various
locations where ancient sports were practised (palaestra, gymnasium, baths,
and so on) and finally establishes the matter of the rest of the volume-
medical gymnastics, as opposed to martial exercise and athletics or the
professional sports of the gladiator. Books 2 and 3 are a detailed analysis
of the history and practice of the many sports the author classifies under
“gymnastica medica”—leaping, various forms of ball games, dancing,
wrestling, throwing of the discus, walking, running, riding, swimming,
hunting, and the like. Included among these are a few of the less well-
known sports‚ however famous among the ancients, such as pancreatic
wrestling, the use of the balterus, and a few activities which we today
would call exercise of a kind if not sport as such—holding the breath‚ loud
speaking, and drills for the voice. Books 4 through 6 are more specifically
medical than those preceding. Book 4 presents the effect of exercise on
different physical types (chap. 7 wonders, for instance, “An corpora aegra
ullo pacto exerceri conveniat’'). Books 5 and 6, following the same order
as books 2 and 3 re-examine each of the sports‚ this time analysing their
benefits and harms from a medical point of view. The chapter “De cursus
natura'' at book 5, chapter 7, for instance, completes the discussion of
running begun in “De cursu” at book 2, chapter 10. Together these two
chapters provide a history and analysis of running as a sport of “gymnas-
tica medica,” including all the benefits and harms that the sport induces.
