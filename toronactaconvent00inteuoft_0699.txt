PETER SHARRATT 673

Muret was born eleven years after Peter Ramus but the two overlapped
in Paris for only about three years. Ramus lacked Muret‘s literary sensibili-
ty, but he did use literature to illustrate his philosophica] and scientific
texts and his theory of “analysis” and “genesis'’ constitutes an original
approach to literary criticism and to creative writing. His educational
theory “Quod sit unica doctrinae instituendae methodus,’' with his ac-
count of the method of nature and the method of prudence, stresses that
the arts should be kept separate in theory but notin practice. Like Muret‚
too, he was concerned with the end product of education “in forum, in
senatum, in concionem populi, in omnem hominum conventumss''¹⁰

A recent account of the question of the perfect orator and its place in
the humanist ideal of education is to be found in Grafton and Jardine
From Humani-sm to the Humanities. Education and the Libera! Arts in F ifleentlz·
and Sixteenth-Century Europe (1987). The authors argue that “utility” is of
first importance for Ramus, as is the social position his pupil will play in
society, and that this institutional reform, which made his doctrine accept-
able to the business world, was one of the causes of opposition to him.
There is, of course, room for discussion about the importance of moral
training in Ramus, and indeed about the relation between moral and civic
responsibility, yet there is much truth in the idea that Ramus “explicitly
(though not necessarily deliberately) achieved the final semlarization of
humanistic teaching-—the tmnsition from ‘humanism' to ‘the humanitiesl ”
Muret‚ in spite of his insistence on the usefulness of a liberal education,
still hankered after the old ideal that the purpose of teaching literature
was intellectual and moral. Towards the end of his life, however, he
became increasingly aware that the ideal did not work in practice, that the
teaching of literature was in a state of crisis, not to say decadence and
disintegration. Jean Jehasse has argued that this decadence (from the
mid-1570s) corresponds to the explosion (e'clatement) of the old encyclope-
dia to include new arts and especially new sciences, as well as to the rise
of literary criticism, accompanied by van‘ous factors of social and political
unrest. Muret nowhere makes clear that he was aware of any of this, but

skilled in all branches of knowledge and capable of presenting their ideas in brilliantly
persuasive words.” Other writers have pointed to the close link between oratory and
teaching, rhetoric and pedagogy, e.g.‚ W. H. Woodward, Studies in Education during the
Age osthe Renaissance (Cambridge, 1906); Carlos G. Norefia, Vim (The Hague: Nijhoff,
