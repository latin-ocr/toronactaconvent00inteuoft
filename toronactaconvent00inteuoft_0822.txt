796 JESUIT DRAMA

As for English history, the following tables are meant to give an idea as
to which subjects were frequently dealt with and to show that the Jesuits’
interest was mainly focused on historical events of periods after the
Norman Conquest. According to these tables, the fate of the English Lord
Chancellor and author of the famous Utopia, Sir Thomas More, was the
most popular subject of the matter in hand. Certainly, the life of St.
Edmund, the fate of Charles 1, the conflict between Henry II and Thomas
Becket or the life of Edward the Confessor, were also quite often present·
ed on Jesuit stages, yet the number of More-dramas is even higher than
the sum of the plays written about these four different subjects. The
undisputed dominance of More-dramas is further enlarged by the fact that
at least three other plays, Rcffmsis‚ Tragoedia, 1612, Fisherus Episcopus
Rffnsis Tragoedia, 1714, and Cromwellus Tragoedia, 1724, also dealt with
the reign of King Henry VIII and his breach with Rome.

The reasons which made British history and especially the above
mentioned subjects so popular among jesuit authors may only be as-
sumed, but not clearly proven. Szarota has suggested that the defeat of the
Spanish Armada and England's subsequent n‘se to become a world-power
directed the Jesuit’s attention to remarkable events and figures in Eng-
