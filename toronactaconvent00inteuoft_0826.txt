800 JESUIT DRAMA

popularity is to be found in the partial portrait of the King’s character and
life. In the extant dramas, Charles is portrayed as a king who favoured
Catholics‚ re-established Catholic rites and planned to reunite his kingdom
with Rome.²³ He becomes, however, a victim of Oliver Cromwell’s in·
trigues‚ the latter stirring up his English subjects against the King. Under
Cromwell's leadership they decide to execute Charles in order to keep
Catholicism out of England. This partial presentation of the historical
event that shocked the world in 1649, allowed thern to depict Charles as
a martyr for the Catholic faith, although this word is not mentioned
expressis verbis.

In contrast to him, Mary Stuart is, in fact, portrayed as a martyr for the
Catholic Church in the two periochae extant. 1 arn quite convinced that the
Jesuits dealt with her fate mainly in order to illustrate the consequences of
Henry VIII’s breach with Rome, Elizabeth being his child by Anne Boleyn.
On the other hand, the unusual fact that two heroines were the focus of
attention on aJesuit stage might have promoted the subject’s popularity.
Mary Stuart is depicted as completely innocent and as a victim of the
intrigues of her half-brother james Murray, who hopes to become king
after her death. Queen Elizabeth, however, fears that Mary could succeed
to the throne' and re-establish Catholicism in England. Her decision to
have Mary executed is therefore a preventive measure she has to take for
the good of her state.²⁴

The characterization of Mary as a weak-minded sacrificial lamb is in
clear contrast to Becket’s committed stand in church matters. Fearless, he
fights against the king's attempts to curtail the traditional privileges and
rights of the Church. As Szarota has illustrated, the conflict between
Henry II and Thomas Becket had in many respects been very attractive for
Jesuit dramatists.²⁵ Firstly, it could be used to symbolize the conflict
between the German princes and the emperor during the Thirty Years
War. Secondly, the subject provided the opportunity to present an ideal
prince of the church, who had dared to oppose the king’s wishes. Thirdly,
the subject also allowed the inclusion of the conflict between Henry II and
his rebellious son, who had tried to seize his father's throne. As
