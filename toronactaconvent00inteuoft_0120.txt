Titus Livius Frulovisi and the uses of Plutarch and Sallust by Bernard
Andre in their lives of Henry V (1438) and of Henry VII (1500-1503).⁸
All of these several traditions of biographical writing were available to the
generation of More and Erasmus, and increasingly we are being made
aware of the richness of the rhetorical tradition itself as well as of the
strategies and techniques available to biographers.⁹

To this wealth that is to be found in the classical tradition as continued
and modified by patristic, medieval and humanistic rhetorical teaching‚ we
must now add the profusion of enlargements or applications of classical
thought in the form of notes, adnotationes, castigationes, prefaces, commen-
taries, and such¹⁰—not excluding the marginal manuscript glosses and
notes which often circulated or were at least read by others than the
scholars themselves.¹¹ The force of the commentaries especially is to
document the use of the texts in teaching‚ and to provide clues as to how
those texts were being interpreted. One central author has been studied
in detail in the studies by J0hn Ο. Ward of medieval and Renaissance
commentaries on Cicero. The continuity of such a master-author cannot

Use of Cicero, Plutarch, and Sallust in the Vita Henrici Quinti (1438) by Titus Livius de
Frulovisi and the Vita Henrici Septimi (1500-1503) by Bernard Andre,'' in Acta Conven-

⁹ This richness is manifested in the collection of Newberry Conference essays
edited by J. J. Murphy in Renaissance Eloquence (Berkeleyz Univ. of California Press,
1983). Quite simply, the role of rhetoric was deepened and enlarged by a number of
Renaissance humanists who did more than merely receive: see Wesley Trimpi, “The
Quality of Fiction: the Rhetorical Transmission of Literary Theory,” Traditio 30 (1974),
enlarged in his Muses os One Mind (Princetonz Princeton UniV. Press, 1983). In this
context it is appropriate to cite two works which indicate the broadening: Charlcs
Trinkaus‚ In Our [mage and Likeness: Humanity and Divinity in Italian Humanist Tkought,
2 vols. (Chicagoz Univ. of Chicago Press, 1970), and Ernesto Grassi, Rhetoric- as
Philosophy (University Station, PA: State Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1980).

¹⁰ For commentaries there is a most useful collection of studies in the volume
edited by August Buck, Der Kommentar in der Renaissance (Boppardt Boldt, 1974). For
a larger vieW‚ see the very useful study by Tore Janson of classical and medieval Latin
Prose Preffaces (Stockholmz 1964), and the studies by O. Schottenloher (1955) and
Gualdo Rosa (1973). -— The general techniques of classical scholarship are surveyed in
J. E. Sandys, A Histmy os Classical Scholarship, 3rd ed„ 3 vols. (Cambridgez Cambridge

Univ. Press, 1908); E. J Kenney, The Classical Text (Berkeleyz Univ. of California Press,
1974), provides a keen analysis of various aspects of editing during this period,
especially emendation.
