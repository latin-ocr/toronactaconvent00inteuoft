Thunderer; but if it false, then you must believe in God and fear
him (163-64)

and this third book closes with a panegyr-ic of the Divine as fulfilling all
the requirements of a Supreme Being.

In book 3 Polignac has taken his reader over difficult terrain. The
physical details of Epicurean atomism do not offer the poet promising
material; but Polignac has been uncompromising in his treatment, and like
Lucretius himself has succeeded in presenting these details in verse which
is not only technically exact but also at times flowing and even pictur-
esque. Yet one cannot miss remarking that in much of his argumentation
Polignac is attacking positions which no longer boasted defenders; the
seventeenth century had produced an atomism which was in many impor-
tant details no longer the atomism of Epicurus and his classical followers;
Gassendi had insisted, for example, that the atoms are not eternal but the
creations of God, and it was this purified atomism that Charleton, Boyle,
and Newton had espoused in England. Nor can it be claimed that the
ultimate objects of Polignac’s attack—the libertins and the philosophas-relied
upon classical atomism as a defence for their moral beliefs; Polignac has
confused with Epicureanism a contemporary movement in the direction
of sensualism which has little to do with the classical philosophy.

It has been remarked by more than one Lucretian scholar that while
superstition and uncertainty may have played a disturbing role in the lives
of Epicurus‘s contemporaries, Lucretius’s own age found no difficulty in
outwardly observing the formal demands of religion while attaching little
importance to their substance; that Lucretius, in his polemic against
“religio,” was doing little more than flailing at shadows. 1f there is truth in
this, then it is a strange irony that almost two thousand years later Luc-
retius’s bitterest foe should be found doing much the same as Lucretius
himself. 1 would like to be able to claim that this assessment of the Anti-
Lucretius is original. However, one of Polignac‘s earliest readers came to
a similar conclusion-Voltaire, who remarked of the poem: “c'est employer
de l’artillerie pour detruire une chaumiere.”
