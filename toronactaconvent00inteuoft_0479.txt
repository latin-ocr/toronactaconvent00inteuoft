modern times devoted exclusively to this metre, as well as the largest
collection of such poems: altogether seventy poems with more than 1800
verses. One should take into consideration that Pontano wrote these
poems when Marullo had announced his opposing poetic view and when
Mantuanus had raised his principa} objections from a Christian position.
Pontano did not care. He chose a title sola metri lege, which Pliny the
Younger had used before him, and recommended his two books in the
opening poems to the inspiration of the Catullan Muse. The poems,
dedicated to his friend Marino Tomicelli, deal with the pleasurable life at
the spa of Baiae near Naples, where the most charming puellae and his
best amici meet. Some poems are modelled on speciflc Catullan ones, but
this occurs not as often comparatively as in his earlier Catullan collections.
The general Catullan style of Pontano, in which certain Catullan peculiari-
ties occur more often than in Catullus, is brought to a mastership of its
own. The tone is playful and joking, the atmosphere serene, cheerful, and
full of laughter. At the same time, Pontano shn'nks from no taboo in his
erotic representations, although he avoids specifically obscene words. This
inclusion of sexual actions is not only strictly against the moralistic poeti·
cal code of Marullo, it surpasses even Catullus by far. But Pontano always
connects Catullan motives with such representations. This seems to show
that Pontano even here wants to be seen as following Catullus or at least
as being on a way opened by Catullus. The dominant term of the Hende-
casyllabi sive Baiarum libri II is voluptas. He used it at van'ous prominent
places in the collection and Voluptas appears personified in the last poem
as the last word, where he wishes his future readers: Sic vobis in amore nil
amarum, s nil insit nisi dulce, sic amando s et noctes pariter diesque agatis, s
assistat lateri et comes Voluptas. The term voluptas was, of course, known to
Pontano and his contemporaries as the leading Epicurean term. In Loren-
zo Valla’s dialogue De vera voluptate (1433s49) the poet Maffeo Vegio had
defended the Epicurean position. To defend the voluptas of Epicurus as
the highest aim, was, in the fifteenth century only possible under the
protection of poetica lieentia. The poetical example of Catullus and his
differentiation between the castus et pius poeta and his versus molliculi et
parum pudici made possible and legitimized for Pontano a poetry of
Epicureanism, which he kept apart from his Chn'stian beliefs. Thus,
Catullus had a role in the complex process in which certain humanists
separated themselves more or less from the precepts ands or doctrines of
Christianity.

In this way, the basic lines of origin and early development of the new
Catullan poetry may be drawn. Other humanists, less prominent as
Catullan poets, could be mentioned. At the beginning of the sixteenth
