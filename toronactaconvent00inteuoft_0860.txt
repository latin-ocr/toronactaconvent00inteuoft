854 THE LATIN POEMS OF TYCHO BRAHE

Scilicet his studiis Virtus generosa probatur,
Nobile nobilitas forte requirit opus.

(vv.18i84)

According to Tycho the only good to come from these occupations is the
good they do to the body, whereas science-and this is how Tycho presents
his own alternative-science is the occupatiori of the mind, mens: “My mind
burns for greater deeds'':

At mea Mens ausis operum maioribus ardet,
In quibus excellens cernitur esse labor.

(vv.197-98)

This pair, body versus mind, announces a comparison between nobility
and science in terms of perishable versus eternal. The bodily, and earthly,
occupations of his fellow noblemen are compared unfavorably with his
own astronomical, that is celestial, pursuits. This is his justification of the
choice he has made: a philosophie demonstration, so to speak, that not
only has he chosen a better way of life, he has chosen the only one that
has any real value—as opposed to the vanity of the aristocratic occupations.

As a consequence Tycho becomes able to describe his choice as a
mystical experience in the neo-platonic tradition. His emancipation from
the aristocratic ideals becomes the emancipation of the mind from the
perishable body and its ascension towards the heavens where it belongs.

“Whoever delights in flying through the castles of heavens, and making
his genius approach the stars——his interests are different from those of
men, and similar to those of the gods. He knows a way to make his mind
rise from earth.’'

Quisquis enim superas animo volitare per arces,
Syderaque ingenio gaudet adire suo,

Dissimiles hominum curas, similesque Deorum,
Et sua quo terris Mens relevetur, habet.

(vv.207-10)

Variations on this theme, this description of science, are to be found in
several of Tycho's poems—even from later pen‘ods when justification
towards the aristocratic milieu was no longer the problem at stake.

One example from the time at Hven is the Paraeneticum ad astronomioe
cultores, which was printed in his Astronomiae instauratoe progymnasmata.⁵

⁵ Printed posthumously in Prague, 1602, but for the most part written before
