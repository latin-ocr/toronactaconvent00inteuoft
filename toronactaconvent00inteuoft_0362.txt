358 V1V1-:s' EARLY WR1T1Ncs

ipsumque somniantem ostendit Scipionem, ex quo me iussit per-
contari totius illius lucubrati et vigilati somnii enarrationem. Operae
pretium fuerit singula a capite ipso cognoscere et describere vobis
templum illius dei, cui vos tam crebro tam libenter sacrificatis, ne
ignoretis eum locum in quem piis animis operaturi sacris saepe
convenitis. (Somn. l)⁶

The cum precedes an imperfect subjunctive this time, and the main verb
describes not further action by the narrator but an initiative by the god
Sleep during a specific appropriate moment in the course of Vives’ own
activity. The audience, namely the Louvain students to whom Vives is
preparing to lecture, is sharply defined and specific. The writer wastes no
time in turning the topic, sleep and dreams, into a gentle reproach
directed at the lazy habits of his youthful hearers. Sleep's realm is vividly
detailed‚ using Ovid's Metamorphoses Book 11 as a springboard. Among the
three introductions we are studying it is here that Vives presents himself,
his listener, and the events in the clearest focus with the least doubt about
exactly what is going on.

Another facet of the fancifuljourneys that shows maturation of style is the
way in which the author includes himself as a character in the expen'ence. In
all three pieceS, Vives is in some way the inquisitive learner. In the Genethlia-
con, Vives seeks out opportunities to elevate the Virgin‘s wisdom and learn-
ing by contrast with his own secular stupidity and the worthlessness of his
secular erudition. His idea is to present, much as he does in ordinary life for
Briard or others, a little product of his scholarship as a gift:

. . . ad blandam benignamque Matrem conversus, “quam tibi, dulcis
et sacra Virgo, placeret‚’' inquam, “si ex astris quid sit tuo isti Filio
fati eventurum praenuntiarem?'' Illa vero me tam delirantem limis
nonnihil intuita (qui Virginis mos semper fuit) in viam reducere
brevi ac facili compendio volens, “et qua,” inquit, “hunc putas
natum coniunctione? quibus signis?'' Tum ego: “Dicam equidem,
tametsi varietas visa est in coelis. . . .” (p. 5)

Vives launches into an astrological analysis of the position of the planets
and the signs of the zodiac, concluding:

non desunt qui Martem esse asserant in mortis contubernio:
idcirco hoc momenti natum, crucis candidatum praefantur.
