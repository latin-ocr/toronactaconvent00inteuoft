330 HISTORIOGRAPHY AND HUMANISM

Some months after the edition had been printed, carrying an idealized
portrait of Chn'stian II on the title page, Elisabeth was married to Chris-
tian by proxy in Brussels. Next summer a Danish delegation brought the
queen home. At the departure from the Netherlands the Danish orator
gave an eloquent Latin speech, whose text is known. And to my surprise,
I discovered that he had woven a long quotation from one of Saxo's
poems into his oration. When eulogizing King Christian, he uses a flatter-
ing characterization in Saxo of one of the earliest heroic kings. Again,
Christian is being linked with the ancient kings of Denmark, although
without help the allusion to Saxo must have been impossible to catch for
the foreign audience.¹²

In any case, Saxo’s history of Denmark won rapid circulation, and was
reprinted twice during the sixteenth century. Erasmus of Rotterdam’s
famous words of praise in the dialogue Ciceronianus from 1528 are a clear
indication of the qualities humanists found in Saxo. The hypercritical
Ciceronian of the dialogue says of Saxo: “1 like his lively and ingenious
spirit, his way of speaking that is never drab or sleepy‚ and also his won-
derful abundance of words, his many proverbs and his admirable variation
in rhetorical figures; I like all of this and cannot marvel enough at the way
in which a Dane at this point in time could acquire such mastery of
speech; but there is hardly a trace of Cicero to be found in him.”¹³

Erasmus is only concerned about Latin style in this work, so that we
cannot expect him to discuss historical method. But in Latin patriotic
historiography the humanists showed a similar preoccupation with style,
to the neglect of method.¹4 Even Saxo’s more dubious legends did not
necessarily give offence, and the speeches in his work, inspired as they
were by classical historiography, were fully in consonance with the hu·
manists’ own efforts.

For Danish history writers the publication of Saxo proved to be of the
greatest importance.¹⁵ His authority remained undisputed for a long

standards, among those mentioned.
