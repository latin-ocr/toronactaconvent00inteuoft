Agricola’s influence upon Alonso can be further uaced in the latter’s
classification of the kinds of topics. Although Alonso already knew the
classifications established by Aristotle, Cicero, Themistius, Boethius and
Titelman, he complements them, as he himself states, with many of the
elements postulated by Agricola, as in the case of internal and external
topics.¹² Alonso goes on to explain that Aristotle’s exposition of the
topics is obscure, and that this fact prompted Cicero, Themistius and
Boethius to set upon the task of elucidating them, but that, however, it
was not possible to cast any light upon the subject until Agricola con-
densed all the former systemS, endowing them with a new structure, far
more simple, useful and adequate to the taste of the contemporary
humanists:

Haec omnia adduxi, vt sicut labor Rodolphi non solum non
vanus, sed utilis fuerit in locis tradendis post Aristotelem, Ci-
ceronem, Quintilianum, Boetium, Themistium, eoque claris quam
illis hic noster conatus non erit reputandus vanus, quia ad profectum
illorum en't, quibus vel non est copia Rodolphi, vel non tantam
peritiam habent Romani sermonis, vt eum valeant intelligire.¹⁸

In Alonso's view, Agricola’s classification of the topics is far more suitable
to teach this subject, so necessary for the invention and discussion of
human affairs, thus approaching the humanistic ideals mentioned before.
The facts enumerated above show that Alonso was fully aware that his
philosophica! position was leading him towards a humanistic stand;
perhaps he did not succeed completely, but it must be remembered that
his main concern was to eradicate those shortcomings of the scholastics
that had caused the most violent disapproval among the new thinkers of
the Renaissance. One of the points in contention was the corruption of
Latin, which stemmed from the lack of interest for the language itself, and
from the singleminded attention to the straightforward and utilitarian
expression of ideas. Alonso was not satisfied with using the language in a
haphazard manner, with only just enough clarity to express his thoughts;
instead, he strove to avoid the barbarisms that under the cover of tech-
nicisms the scholastics introduced into the vocabulary‚ and from a syntac-
tic standpoint, he endeavoured to recover the classical models within the
limits forced upon him by the pedagogical nature of his works. A note-
