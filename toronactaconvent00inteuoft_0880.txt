852 SIXTEENTH-CENTURY PHILOSOPHERS FROM NEw SPAIN

worthy proof of Alonso's interest in the return to the classica! models is
furnished by the abundant quotations of Cicero and Seneca that are found
throughout his philosophica] writings. Another humanistic trait, or, in
other words, another sign of the humanistie influence absorbed by
Alonso, manifests itself in his interest in freeing the philosophica! doe·
tn'ne’s body from the treatises condemned as abstruse by authors such as
Vives and Erasmus.¹⁴ Thus, he eliminates the treatises that deal with
logical obligationS, insoluble or paradoxieal propositions and the calcula-
tions, following the criticisms east upon these scholastie doctrines by the
humanistie dialectieians. On the other hand, he strove to integrate the
innovations developed by Agricola on the subject of dialectic topies into
logie, Alonso's own field of study.

Tomas de Mercado

This Dominiean philosopher, theologian and economist was born in
Seville and went to Mexieo while still an adolescent. There, he entered the
Order of Preachers around 1522 and was assigned to the Santo Domingo
convent in the capital city. In this convent school he studied philosophy
and theology, continuing later his education there, where he obtained the
degree of Master in Arts and Theology.¹⁵ Following his ordination, he
was appointed in 1558 as lecturer in Arts at the same convent of Santo
Domingo, which post he held until 1562, and where he also served as
pn'or for a short period, until he was transferred to Spain. In this country
he furthered his studies at Salamanea and later at Seville where he also
taught philosophy, moral theology and law, and acted as moral counselor
for the merchants. During his stay in Spain Tomas published his works,
which, which may be considered as a product of his pedagogieal experi-
enees in Mexieo, as suggested, among other clues, by the place-names he
quotes and the examples he uses, in which things appertaining to the New
Spain are mentioned. Tomas' commentary on the Tractatus or Summulae
