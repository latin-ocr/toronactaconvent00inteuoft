126 PROBATI AUTORES

es” (ASD Ix-2, p. 86:560-61). Discussing the correct use of the preposi-
tions ex and de, he rejected Stunica's position on similar grounds: “So far
he has found no standard Latin author [autorem probatum] to prove what
he asserts’' (ibidem, p. 78:352).

In the second edition of the New Testament (1519) Erasmus provided
an Index solecismorum, a list of unidiomatic expressions in the Vulgate. To
each item he added a brief comment, noting that the traditional wording
deviated from standard usage. “Venit ministrare . .. is not Latin’‘; “What
Latin speaker ever said ad invicem?'’ “What Latin speaker ever said audi-
tum for ‘words spoken‘?’' (LB VI fol. *5 verso). Stunica reacted angrily to
what he considered irreverent criticism of a text endorsed by a long
tradition. The Vulgate version, he insisted, was both correct and ele-
gant.¹³ He was hard pressed, however, to verify this statement and ad-
vance cogent arguments against Erasmus. In his apologia, the latter
staunchly maintained his position, insisting that Stunica document the use
of disputed phrases in standard authors. An unusual expression could only
be excused “if that form of speech can be found in probatos autores'’ (LB
IX 393C). “Let Stunica show that probatos autores spoke thus,’' he demand-
ed (ibidem, 395F). In a few cases Stunica was successful in finding a
classical precedent. Erasmus responded by raising his standards and
rejecting the testimony of Plautus, Terence, and Suetonius. Plautus was an
“obsolete'' author, he claimed, who indulged in “poetic licence”. One
could not use him as a norm for prose composition (ibidem, 39313). Nor
did Suetonius meet the standards of the more exacting judges of the Latin
language.¹‘¹ The translator must use discretion in following the usage of
Roman writers, “or else one might say scibo instead ofsciam, because Terence
spoke thus’' (ibidem, 39813). As for later Christian writers—they did not count
at all. “The fact that Ambrose spoke thus, does not make it Latin'’ (ibidem,
3953).

Even if Erasmus does not explicitly refer the reader to probati autores, it
is clear that he emended the Vulgate on the basis of classical usage. His
annotations on Paul's Epistle to the Colossians furnish representative
examples: At 129 he replaced non desinimus pro vobis orantes et postulantes
with non desinimus orare et postulare since in classical usage desinere
demands a complementary infinitive. At 1:13 he replaced filii dilectionis by

¹⁸ Jacobus Stunica, Assertio ecclesiasticae translationis (Romez [Bladus] 1524) sig. A ii
verso.
¹⁴ LB IX 3953. One reason why Erasmus had reservations about accepting

Suetonius as a model was his predilection for Graecisms. Cf LB VI 21813: Suetonius suo
more Graecam loquutionem reserens. . . .
