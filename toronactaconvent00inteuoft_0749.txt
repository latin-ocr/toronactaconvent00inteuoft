KAREN SKOVGAARD·PET1·:RSEN 723

Erik 14 did not achieve his goal, and thus Laetus can use this in his
polemics as an example of Albrecht’s—and indirectly of En'k's—ridiculously
exaggerated ambitions.

When Laetus published Margaretica, in 1573, Denmark was still the
leading country of the North. Eighty·five years later, in 1658, the balance
of power between the two countries was completely reversed. In the
course of the Thirty Years War, Sweden had become one of the leading
European powers, and had now conquered the Scanian provinces along
with a number of other areas from Denmark. The Swedish king Charles
10 Gustav even planned to bring the whole of Denmark under his rule. At
a certain point he actually controlled most of the country, but the Danish
capital Copenhagen was still left to conquer. Consequently‚ he surrounded
the city in the autumn of 1658.

Even this rather unflattering situation could become glorious in Danish
anti-Swedish epics. The Swedish siege of Copenhagen is the subject of no
fewer than two Latin epics, owing to the fact that the Swedish king was
not successful in his attempt to take Copenhagen, and Denmark thus
remained independent.

One of these poems, Amagria vindicata (l book, 926 lines), is written by
the Danish philologist and scientist Ole Borch (1626-1690).2 It deals with
a single encounter‚ in which the Danes overcame the Swedes on the island
of Amager a little outside Copenhagen. The poem is almost solely con-
cerned with the Swedish King Charles who has surprisingly many traits in
common with his Swedish predecessor Albrecht in Laetus’ Margaretica.
Just as Laetus' Albrecht is convinced that he will conquer the provinces of
Scania, Charles considers it a small matter to conquer the whole of
Denmark. Both kings are advised against these presumptuous projects;
and both entirely ignore the warnings. They do not become aware of their
unjust greed until they have suffered well-deserved defeat.

One morning Charles tells his men that he has had a dream the night
before, in which one of his great predecessors on the Swedish throne
Gustav Adolf (who died in the Thirty Years War) appeared before him
(Amag. 167-70):

Adfuit & toto Gustavus luridus ore

Hei mihi! quam pallens? quam loti sanguine vultus?
Exhaustaeque genae, capitisque orbata capillis
Area, δε a Lycio praecordia fossa tumultu?

² The Amagria vindicata was probably written shortly after 1660, but it was not
published until 1693 (see the Bibliography).
