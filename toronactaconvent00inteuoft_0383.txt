and by recent editors.⁸ In the introduction he gives a short biography of
Vinet and an account of his relations with Scaliger, using uncompromising
language in which everything is very much black and white. Vinet is the
modest hero inspired by the pious quati-ain on Phoebus-born Ausonius
placed on the College de Guyenne in 15439 but subsequently disti-acted
by all sorts of other matters; Scaliger on the other hand is a vain, dogmat·
ic, and mendacious tyrant. According to Mirmont the young Scaliger
misappropriated the results of Vinet’s work and passed some things off as
his own, and later, after Vinet's death in 1587, further turned the knife by
accusing Vinet of plagiarism.10

Before we descend further into melodrama, let us consider the available
evidence. This consists of the emendations themselves, which I will consid-
er shortly, and the prefaces, which 1 will deal with first. Several letters in
fact passed between the two men, but only one remains, the one dated 29
August 1573; this was printed as a preface to Scaliger’s Amonianae Lec-
tione-2¹¹ Vinet’s view of these matters is given in the preface to his com·
mentary of 1580.¹² Vinet says that his work progressed in the following
way. After seeing the edition of 1558 he expressed his views with due
politeness to its careless editor, Charpinus. It was several years later
(probably 1564) when he first saw the manuscript, which Cujas, who
owned it, had lent to Turnebus. Vinet made various emendations to the
text and sent his version to Greyff at Lyons at the printer's request. (The
date of this can be deduced as either 1567 or 1568, probably the former.)
Nothing happened, at least in Lyons. Sometime after that (the date is not
known) some emendations made by Vinet were revealed to Scaliger by
one jacobus Salomo, and at least one of them was warmly praised by
Scaliger. In 1572 Vinet wrote to Smliger, who was now in the vicinity of
Lyons, to ask him to give Greyff a prod and try to speed things up; he
wrote two letters in fact, and received two replies. Scaliger gave his help,
but actually did more than he had promised, producing the ediu'on and
commentary already mentioned. Vinet withdrew his text and had it

printed by Millanges at Bordeaux as quickly as a severe shortage of paper
allowed.
