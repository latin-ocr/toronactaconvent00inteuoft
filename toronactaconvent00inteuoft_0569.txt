poem. In this case, too, it is clear that as a poet Grotius was read by and
sollicited reactions from a wide audience. This was, of course, furthered
by his fame, which ensured that all his statements in this field were
considered important and worthy of attention.

In the Sala Regia of the Vatican there is a large fresco by Giuseppe
Porta “Il Salviati” dating from 1563. It shows us how in 1177 Freden'c
Barbarossa had submitted to Pope Alexander 111 after his defeat in the
struggle for hegemony in Northern Italy.¹⁷ In an inscription under the
fresco the contribution of Venice, an ally of the Pope, to the victory was
described rather more elaborately than truthfully.¹⁸ In 1632 Pope Urba-
nus VIII had the inscription painted out, following recent historical
insights. The introduction, three years later, of a new inscription, in which
the role of Venice was not mentioned at all‚¹⁹ resulted in a diplomatic
conflict, which ran so high that the Venetians even considered expulsion
of the papal nuncio.

In February of 1636 Grotius heard of this. He became highly interested
and mentioned the matter in several letters. In a letter to his brother
Willem²⁰ he even incorporated a poem which showed his strongly anti-
papal views. This is in accordance with other statements made by Grotius
in his correspondence during this period, to the effect that the Pope had
far too much influence on French society and politics.²¹ Thus he is led
to express in his poem an opinion which is in conflict with the true events
regarding the disputed inscription: Grotius unquestioningly assumes that
the Venetian, anti-papal version of the incident was the right one.

The qualities of this poem are less conspicuous than those of the
