810 νινΕ3’3 THEORY OF DELmERATlvss ORATORY

perhaps suggest and argue that through the broad definition of the field
of deliberative oratory, Vives aims not only at the political counsellor in
the strict sense, but at any educated member of Christian society who
masters the principles of rhetoric. Thus, the vast range of opera manuum
and actiones animi, defined as the subject of deliberative oratory, would
comprise any topic an intellectual writer, any orator or rhetor, might choose
to write upon, with the restriction that it be treated according to Vives’s
moral standards. If this makes sense, then De consultatione could perhaps
be useful to help understand the nature and purpose of many sixteenth-
century writings with a rhetorical structure written by authors who profess
to write as a rhetor or orator. De consultatione should then not only be con-
sidered as a treatise on a specific kind of oratory with limited range, but
also as a theoretical description of the function of rhetoric in the early
sixteenth-century intellectual community.
