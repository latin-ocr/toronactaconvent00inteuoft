484 THE LITURGICAL CONTEXT OF ERASMus’s HYMNs

to return to Herod, consoling Christ in Gethsemani‚ comforting Mary
after Chn‘st's death, and telling the women that Christ had risen from the
tomb.²¹ Here the omissions are clearly deliberate, since Erasmus opens
the section on the annunciation with the question: “Cuncta quid frustra
sequimur canendo?’' (“Why should we vainly try to sing all your
deeds?’').²² Finally, the Lorettan sequence (which has, as far as 1 know,
no precedents in its subJect matter) makes no mention whatever of the
legend which gave the shrine its fame: the angelic transportation of the
santa casa of Mary and Joseph from Nazareth to Italy. Instead Erasmus
limits himself to the symbolic associations of the laurel which gave the
shrine its name.²³

Erasmus is equally fastidious in the varying style of these four hymns.
As we would expect, he eschews the accentual, rhyming patterns of most
medieval hymns. The hymn to St. Gregory is wn'tten in third-asclepiadean
strophes, rare during the later Middle Ages until they were revived by the
humanists in the fifteenth century. The hymn to Gregory is brief, plain,
dignified, instructive‚ entirely suited for actual use as a matins hymn. Τὴε
angel poems, written in sapphic strophes, are longer and loffier, with some
epic touches and some high coloring, for, as Erasmus says in the introduc-
tion to the suite, it is fitting that the fiery ranks be celebrated in words of
fire.²⁴ And the angel poems lack the contorted classicism of such a poem
as the poetic dialogue between Erasmus and his friend Cornelis Gerard.²⁵

The hymn to St. Ann is written in quatrains of quantitative iambic
dimeters‚ pretty clearly in imitation of the last great classical hymnist‚
Prudentius, whose poems Erasmus admired; he even wrote a commentary
on two of them for More’s daughter Margaret Roper.²⁶ In his title Eras-

²³ We should not make too much of Erasmus's critical intentions in this omission,
since the story, given currency by a phamphlet of Mantuan and not fully discredited
until this century, was still recent and recognized as only a pious legend when Erasmus
wrote. Bulls issued by Julius 11 and Leo X recommended pilgrimage to the shrine but
refrained from endorsing the story on which it is based. The first published attempt
to give the pious legend a spurious historical basis did not occur until 1531, eight
years after Erasmus wrote his liturgy. See Henri Leclercq, “Lorette” in Dictionmire
d'amhe‘ologie chr-§tienne et de liturgic, ed. Fernand Cabrol et al.‚ 15 vols. (Parisz Letousey
