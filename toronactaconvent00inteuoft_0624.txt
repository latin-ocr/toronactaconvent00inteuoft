Cowley's “The Epicure” takes even more liberties with the text. That we
should find so free a treatment of this anacreontic is not surprising,
however, in that it is one of the most imitated of the series, having been
available to Latin and vernaculas poets alike in its version in the Greek
Anthology (A.P. xi, 147). Both Thomas More and Joannes Secundus trans-
late it more or less literally‚ with Secundus, however, adding here and
there a ssourish to the text.¹¹ Where More states directly, “Aurum non
ego persequor‚'' (Gold 1 do not pursue), Secundus makes a triple denial,
“Non me argentum, non gemma, nec aurum l Detentat,'' (Neither silver,
nor gems, nor gold tempt me). While More attempts to render the short,
end—stopped anacreontic line, Secundus turns the hemiambics into elegiae
couplets, smoothing out the short phrases into longer more melodic ones:
“Cura est vnguento fluat vt mihi barba fragranti, l Cura vt odoriferis cingam
mea tempora sertis.” Further‚ Secundus inserts a line at this point before
returning to the literal text, commenting on the pervasiveness of care at this
time of life: “Curae sunt dubiae tantum presentia vitae s Tempora.”

Yet these liberties are few in comparison with those that other transla-
tors take. Salmon Macrin freely substitutes Midas for Gyges as an example
of a wealthy tyrant; Ronsard and later Bai‘f do the same in their versions
of this anacreontic, substituting, however, the great Turk or the Tartar.
Further‚ when Macrin arrives at the sections of the lyric where pleasure is
summoned, he is not content merely to perfume his beard or crown his
head with roses. Beckoning young girls to his side, he exhorts:

Sat mihi Iuventae tempora floridae
Inter decoras ducere virgines
Ventura securo quid orbi

Afferat hora boni malive . . ‚¹²

Let it be enough for me to spend my time
Of flowering youth among lovely virgins,
Secure, whatever the hour of the world
May bring either of good or ill;

Like Macrin, Bais in his French version extends both the renunciation of
empire and the invitation to pleasure. Once crowned with flowers, he
welcomes his loved one into his embrace:

Elegantissimi opera (Paris, 1561), 91v-92r.
