WALTHER LUlec 455

there are several poems which are modelled as variations to specific
Catullan poems (Am. 1.5‚ for instance, in which the author plans to give
his nivea columba to his puella, is a variation of the passer-poems3 sexual
connotations in the invisaged activities of the columba clearly indicate that
Pontano wanted his poem to be allegorically understood and that he,
therefore, interpreted the passer-poem itself in a similar way, as, later on,
Poliziano). Finally, Pontano followed Catullus in his general themes‚ the
erotic pleasures with puellae, the witty conversation with amici and the
rude invectives against enemies, and gave the whole a light and gay, joking
and pleasurable, exclusive and sometimes rough and very obscene tone.

A second phase of Pontano's Catullus-imitation is shown by his Liber
Parthenopaeus, which he dedicated to his friend Lorenzo Bonincontri in
Naples in 1457. This book comprises the first twenty-eight poems of his
printed Liber Amorum I. Pontano placed in this book four poems from the
Prin-itus, but only those which do not contain elements of crude obscenity
and invective. Again he assembled a variety of metres in this book; eight
poems are in hendecasyllabics. The poems are mostly erotic in content.
Motives of the Roman elegists occur. But above all, Pontano wanted to be
measured on Catullus. He wanted his verses to be molles, lepidi, leves, iocosi.
He states in the closing poem (Am. 128) that he tried to follow the
nequitiae, the procacitas and the elegantia of Catullus and claims that poems
of this sort were not heard in the last thousand years. He emulated also
the Catullan poems of Landino; apparently he intended to come closer to
the frank style of Catullus. An analysis of the metres, the themes‚ the
stylistic features and the content of the poems shows that he tried to
imitate Catullus on all these levels. The difference in the Pruritus is to be
seen first in the quantity of these imitations, second in the avoidance of
crude obscenities. But he loved erotic representations. The general
atmosphere of the book is cheerful and optimistic. He may show himself
in the role of a frustrated exclusus amator, or an unhappy love may provoke
the idea of death. But, in the same poems or in the next ones, such
emotions are replaced by hopes for more pleasurable events—a reconcilia-
tion may occur or the lover consoles himself with an other puella, who
compensates his loss to his full satisfaction. There is never a desperation
without recovery‚ never the pathetic love for the one and only beloved. It
seems Pontano thought that he followed Catullus also in this emotional
condition.

Tbese Catullan poems of Pontano gave impulses to other humanists to
try the Catullan style too. The strongly increased distribution of the text
of Catullus and the recognized principle of the imitation of the ancients
could independently lead to imitations of Catullus. But Michele Marullo
