514 PRINTED COMMONPLACE BooKs

Bade’s careful commentary on his headed extracts called Silvae morales
(Lyons, 1492) and of Jacob Wimpfeling’s Adolescentia (Strasburg, 1500), a
commonplace book hedged round with salutary injunctions. What really
stabilised the rhetorical commonplace book and enabled a methodical
exploitation of its resources was neither exegesis nor moral caution so
much as the dialectical process of verbal composition promoted first by
Rudolphus Agricola (1443-1485).6 At the same time as the heyday of the
Margarita poetica, Agricola’s place-logie came to provide the skeletal frame-
work of any connected passage of writing, to be fleshed out and orna-
mented from the stored riches of the commonplace book. It is on the
assumption of a firm dialectica} substructure underpinning new composi-
tions built up by commonplaces that major influences like Erasmus and
Melanchthon and a host of other humanists provide the headings, the lay-
out, the extrapolated quotations, synonyms, aphorismS, adages, simili-
tudes, apophtheng, examples and epithets for hundreds of different
commonplace books, which, with their more fastidious choice of source·
material and with a purer Latinity, soon made the Margarita poetica
redundant.

Even this small example of printed commonplace books compiled
before 1503 shows 1 hope, how nicely they exemplify, and, to some extent,
create the range of thought-patterns and the different matrices of style
and language available at the dawn of Northern humanism. It is not
possible here to attempt further analyses of later commonplace books, but
it is possible to give a sense of just a few of the issues they raise about
neo-Latin culture and its influence.

We return first to the subject of literary imitation. For humanist teach-
ers and their pupils, the analysis of pre-existing texts led as a matter of
course to the generation of new ones. Humanist commonplace books
make the assumption that the reader is a potential writer and propose
themselves as mediators between the old texts they harvest and the new
texts they hold in germ. The headings under which excerpts are classed
(and which tend to become standardised as commonplace books coalesce
during the course of the Renaissance) are overwhelmingly moral (and not
at all dissimilar to the headings in the preaching reference books). They
are partly imposed by editors secking to underscore the moral content of
their largely pagan material; are partly a by-product of the assumption that

conjunction with other advice on compiling commonplace books in the manual De
Ratione studii from the 1530s on.
