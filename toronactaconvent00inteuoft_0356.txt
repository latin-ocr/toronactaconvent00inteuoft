fication of the Goths of the Great Migration with the Swedish tribe of the
same name. He diligently explored the various classical and early medieval
sources concerning the migrations of the Goths and their kingdoms in
Europe and Africa. In a bold combination of this material with biblical
genealogy and some of Saxo's most shadowy figures he created a series of
143 Swedish kings, from Noah’s grandson Magog to his own contempo-
rary Gustavus Vasa.

We do not know when Johannes Magnus began to read Saxo. But
another of his sources was Albert Krantz, who often mentions Saxo, as we
saw. In 1525, Johannes Magnus came across a manuscript of Krantz’s
History of the Nordic Kingdoms in Lfibeck, and he at once had a copy made
of the part dealing with Sweden.¹⁸ If not before, he now realized how
important it was to emulate Saxo.

Saxo was vital forJohannes Magnus as a historical source, but the form
of Saxo's work also influenced him. He may have contemplated writing
parts of his history as a mixture of prose and verse, like Saxo did in his
first eight books. A verse monologue, in sapphic stanzas, is put into the
mouth of one of the early kings.¹⁹ The sapphic stanza is one of Saxo's
favourite metres, and Saxo's poems are likewise only used for dialogue.
But the sapphic poem remained the only verse inJohannes Magnus: it was
probably too time-consuming to write just as good classicizing poetry as
Saxo had done, even for a well-educated sixteenth-century humanist.

The speeches in Johannes Magnus are not written to emulate Saxo
alone, because they belong to the genre as such. In one speech, however,
Saxo plays a very important role, and this speech is moreover almost the
climax of the whole work.²⁰ It is ascribed to one of the leading Swedish
patriots of the early sixteenth century, Hemming Gadh, but modern
historians have been able to prove that it is entirely a fabrication on the
part of Johannes Magnus himself.²¹ The speech is an eloquent diatribe
against the Danes and their machinations, and almost all illustrations of its
thesis are taken from Saxo.

Johannes Magnus quotes Saxo for saying about himself and his Danes:

perhaps Egil Petersen, “Hemming Gadhs Tale mod de Danske,” (Dansk) Histon'sk
