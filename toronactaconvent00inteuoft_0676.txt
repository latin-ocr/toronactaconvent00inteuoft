652 LA DANSE MACABRE AND DRURY’s MORs COMOEDIA

spectacular and sumptuous so that their performances attracted, as did
Drury’s Mors, also the general public of the town.

The plot may be summarized as “Death duped.''³⁴ A n'ch old miser
(Chrysocancrio) has a son (Scombn'o), eager to remove his father. He thus
sends his servant (Crancus) to find Death, and engages him to kill the old
man. He even gives himself into his hands under certain condition& The
Devil, who joins them, promises him his father’s n‘ches, if he is willing to
be his after death. Scombrio agrees on sly conditions.

When, after a while, the old man seems to have disappemed, both Death
and Devil demand their dues, truly media in vita, as their victim is still alive.
They only now detect their having been duped by his and his servant's
slyness. Before the judge they both lose their case. Whereas Chrysocancn'o
promises to lead a better life, Death and the Devil depart duped.

Drury’s characters stem from different provenances. The Italian com-
media del ane supplies a number of stock types: Pantaloon as the simple,
rich and aged father (Chrysocancrio)‚ the role of Harlequin is doubled
here as two smart and witty servants (Craneus, Grinco), there is also
Scaramuch, the braggard captain (Frangicostonides), the dottore (here just
mentioned). Other characters are taken from the medieval morality play,
e.g., personified figures of Death and “a devil.” Death, the title hero, plays
an acting (though minor) part. Along with his counterpart “a devil,” he
appears in the stereotype role of the looser and both remain in the end as
cheated cheaters. Another medieval figure is a witch (Grampogna), the
only female in the play. She, too, plays a harmless role, as it were taken
rather from a puppet show, and nothing like a satanic temptress.

Most characters remain quite flat and lack both depth and profile. Just
as the devil has none of the metaphysical qualities of the fiendish adver-
sary or diabolos, the miser, t00, embodies only “the type” and lacks any
profound wickedness of his classical (in Herodot or Ovid), his biblical (as
Samuel's sons or Jehoiakim), his medieval (as Everyman) or Renaissance
counterparts (in Poggio or Macropedius).
