296 PTOLEMY’S GEOGRAPHIA

the world, which whatever the length of his stade was reasonable enough,
Ptolemy accepted Posidonius' revised estimate of 180,000 stades. As a
result, among other defects, his equivalent for the length of the Mediterra-
nean in degrees of longitude, always difficult to calculate in antiquity, was
quite excessive.¹²

Angelus' translation was completed two generations before the editio
princeps mentioned above, forerunner of so many Latin editions, which
outnumber Greek editions by 15 to 1. This and its immediate succes-
sors¹³ adopted Angelus’ misleading title Cosmographia, his preface (often
with a dedication as well) and his translation, the last two with little or no
revision. But any reader of Latin will gather an increasing mass of infor·
mation from the prefaces. Thus the Bologna editor of 14771‘* was proud
of having the first printed maps made from copper plates, which could be
either exactly repeated or modified, and so reach a wide public. We learn
from his preface that Conrad Sweynheym, the German printer woiking in
Italy, instructed certain mathematici between 1474 and 1477, when he died,
in the art of producing copper plates. Unfortunately their printing of
Roman numerals let them down, so that instead of M.CCCC.LXXVII
(1477) they left out two letters, XV, and gave a totally wrong date for the
edition, as if it had come out in 1462.

The largest number of early editions was published in Rome. The first
Rome edition (1478)¹⁵ has a preface by Arnold Buckinck, which starts
from Hipparchus‘ celestial co-ordinates of heavenly bodies, based on a
geocentn'c universe, and says vir sagacis ingenii Ptolemaeus did the same for
the earth. However, so that arts as well as science may be represented and
really good Latinity be incorporated, he has drawn on the services of the
scholar Domitius Calderinus of Verona, so that the ears of his revered
patron may not be offended by the ignorance of the scribes. Ptolemy’s
floruit is given too late a period, and in general Renaissance editors are
hazy about his life.

The year 1482 was notable for two very different publications of
Ptolemy's Geography. Of these, Berlinghieri’s Florence edition does not
particularly concern this conference, since it was in Italian tevza rima. But
