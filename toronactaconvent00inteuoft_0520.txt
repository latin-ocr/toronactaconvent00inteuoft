Maid, or Whether a Maid May be a Scholar, and it is echoed by her British
counterpart and correspondent Bathsua Pell Makin in her An Essay to
Revive the Ancient Education os Gentlewomen (1673). In the Netherlands it

and 1652, in a volume of opuscula, which was issued not by herself but at
the insistence of her scholarly (male) devotees, initially the Leiden theolo-

in later years. She was never married: whether she did not see herself
yielding to the usual round of wifely domestic duties, even when she was
sought in marriage by men of high repute in poetry and in public life,

Descartes in particular wrote with regret in a letter to Mersenne in effect
