huc innuberetis et aedituaremini; neque tudicularet prognariter
impancrare has allodapas et atroces copias fastidilitas. . . .

If only Ι were to get my wish from you and your colleagues like you
who strive to study (?) and investigate the ancient and true wisdom,
that you would enter here and protect this dwelling, and bravely
withstand the alien and savage bounties (? of commentaries)!

(Aea. 10)

Complimented though he is, Vives is left in the dark by the gatekeeper's
archaic language: “Hui, tum inquam, Quid iste mihi sermonis tam diu a
me auscultatus loquitur?'' (Aed. 11). He is not Evander or an Aborigine,
protests the humanist. The caretaker is disappointed, for, as he says,
“nullus perscrutari domum hanc legum rite possit, qui plene veram
tersamque Latinitatem et antiquariam hanc modice saltem non imbiberit”
(Aed. 11). But later, when Vives asks whether he will be granted entrance
to the most sacred and mysterious recesses of the edifice of Laws, the old
man responds: “Quid prohibet? Tu certe quam illiterati illi multo rectius,
verius, clarius'' (Aed. 14). The point in the larger context is that Vives as a
philosopher is qualified to pursue expertise in law, and better qualified
than betesmoires such as Accorso, Bardo and others.

In the flow of the excursion, however, Vives, while admitting to limita-
tions‚ establishes himself as an authority entitled to speak in this ambience
on a footing of respectability, as when he reassures an inquirer that there
are signs of hope on earth; people of learning are resorting once again to
the wise ancients (Aed. 20). Still, he wears his status diffidently in artistic
terms:

quam multa tecum disserere vellem, . .. nisi vererer ne ego,
qui e foribus solum (ut vides) leges salutavi, alieno decore conspi-
cuus exsistam ac

“ne, si forte suas repetitum venerit olim
grex avium plumas, moveat cornicula risum,
furtivis nudata coloribus.''

(Aea. 21)

He is not hindered, however, from providing the doorkeeper with a
brief disquisition on the Aristotelian notion of epieikeia. This is unusual;
the traveler in adventures such as these ordinarily does not go anywhere
to teach others, but to learn. Here Vives feels at the same time inferior to
and a peer of his interlocutor. There is inconsistency in his sels-portrayal.
Perhaps it comes from an attempt to refine the simple pattern of inferiori—
