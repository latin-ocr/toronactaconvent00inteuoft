712 GRorms AND LEGAL TRADITION

degree of validity even if we should concede that which cannot be conced-

of men are of no concern to him.''l

Certainly Grotius is no atheist, and his background and sympathies are
Protestant. Yet his emphasis on the independence of natural law seems to
align him more with the intellectualist than with the voluntarist side of
theological controversy. The intellectualists held that God wills the good
because it is good; the voluntarists held that what is good is good because
God wills it.² Such an abstract dispute over the relations between intellect
and will in God might seem to have no practical import. Yet on the one
view it will be possible to construet a theory of ethics and jurisprudence
without recourse to theology; on the other view it will not. At the same
time, it is clear that Grotius does not want to abandon voluntarism
altogether. In the next section (12) of the Prolegomena he states that
there is “another source of law besides the source in nature, that is, the
free will of God, to which beyond all cavil our reason tells us we must
render obedience.’'

This intellectualism represents an apparent shift in Grotius's point of
view from his earlier unpublished work, De iure praedae (On the Law of
Prize and Booty) of 1604, a manuscript discovered only in 1864. In that
work he seems to take a simple voluntaristic position, equating the natural
law with the divine will.

Closer inspection, however, shows that his early work is more consistent
with his later work than it appears to be at first sight. Already in 1604 we see
him formulating and struggling with the problem which was to be the focus
of his mag-num opus in 1625. That is, he has already seen that his ideas about
international relations require him to develop some sort of natural law
theory, and he has decided that he will have to develop it without depending
on legal, philosophical or theological tradition in any essential way.

In this early work Grotius shows that he was well aware of the intellec·
tualistsvoluntarist debate, which he locates in the classics, although he
must have known that it was raging among the theologians of his own
time; and he thinks he has the solution. He writes:
