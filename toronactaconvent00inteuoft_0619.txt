Cowley's Anacreontiques
and the Translation ⁰s the Greek Anacreontea

STELLA P. REVARD

l n 1656 Abraham Cowley published among his Miscellanies eleven para-
phrastic tmnslan'ons into English from the Greek anacreontea, the
collection of 61 hemiambic lyrics that the Renaissance thought the genu-
ine work of the sixth-century BC Teian poet, Anacreon. These eleven imita-
tions are not only esteemed by many critics as the most finished of
Cowley' s work,‘ ‘his happiest vein‚’ ’but also conspicuously the best among
the English translations of the anacreontea. Some critics even go so far as
to suggest that they surpass the Greek originals in their sprightliness.l

Cowley’s Anacreontiqrm come at a pivotal time in the history of vernacular
translation, just at the moment when the anacreontea were attaining their
peak of populas-ity. Within a ten-year span Thomas Stanley, Robert Hern'ck,
and Cowley himself published their versions. Although this popularity did
not fade until the nineteenth century—both Byron and Thomas Moore
translated Anacreon—the seventeenth-century translators and particularly
Cowley stand out as the most accomplished. In order to understand Cowley's
success at this medium, we must look back to the beginning of interest in the
anacreontea, when humanist pects, such as Thomas More and Joannes
Secundus, were just turning out the first translations in Latin.

The anacreontea were not freely available poets until 1554, when Henri
Estienne published 55 of the 61 poems with his own Latin translation,
