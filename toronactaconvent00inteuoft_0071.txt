cases there is an obvious link between the content of the note and the
language used. The Danish words concerning the market in Ribe are an
example; also from the student period, notes about Greek studies tend to
be written in Greek. Notes about university affairs and learned life in
general are in Latin right up to the end of the almanac. In Ribe, house-
hold affairs are in Danish—cattle breeding, hay—harvest, brewing of beer,
etc.--whereas Latin and Danish seem to be equally well-suited for notes
concerning school and church.

Often the choice of language seems more arbitrary. A note on an
execution of two criminals begins in Latin and shifts into Greek when it
comes to details, as if the exotic language gives added intensity. Similarly,
Hegelund drops an occasional Greek phrase at dramatic points in his
otherwise Latin notes concerning war events. Drinking parties are regular-
ly mentioned not in words but with a drawing of a cup—as a kind of
euphemism perhaps? When Latin is no longer his normal choice, it is still
used on certain solemn occasions, such as the deaths of important per-
sons, or the disaster when the tower of the church collapsed during a
storm. And, finally, Latin continues to be preferred for personal affairs.
Notes of his official travels are in Danish, while the private trips tend to be
in Latin. The same is true for comments on letter-writing and the compo-
sition of books. At one point, he has had an unpleasant dream of losing
some of his teeth—which he mentions in Latin. And when he grows old,
notes on coughs, fevers and rheumatism are in Latin, while the weather‚
another subject that comes in latish in the notes and gradually grows more
and more important, is invariably mentioned in Danish.

Oralz'ty, Literacy and Print

This variety of written languages had no direct counterpart in speaking.
There was no competition to Danish as the normal spoken language of the
country‚¹⁸ but it existed in a variety of dialects, of which no single one
had as yet acquired the status of the national tongue. However, in some
parts of the population German was important too, mainly among the
highest nobility and artisans. And then there was the spoken Latin of the
learned milieus.

The great maj0ri ty of the population was illiterate and most “literature’'
