696 MARTIAL IN THE RENAISSANCE

In place of a bi-partite structure the commentators appear to perceive
the distich as the structural “unit’' of epigram, not surprisingly, since the
distich is often the metrical unit as well. Each distich has its rhetorical
strategy, figures and wit. Longer epigrams are shown to exploit the distich
structure to allow for movement in diverse directions, for the commenta-
tors recognize “wit'’ and “point’' throughout the epigram, not just at its
conclusion. As such, the epigram's form is its function. Here the meaning
of Mario Praz's suggestion that the Renaissance epigram was the “poetical
counterpart of the false perspective,’' or trompe l’oeil, becomes clear.²⁵
Readers of epigrams enjoy having their worlds turned upside down, their
normal perspective manipulated, with, say, the feats of Hercules appearing
small compared to an emperor’s arena, or with a seemingly tragic event
being made to seem felicitous, or even a long tragic poem being made to
seem trivial compared to the art of a mere epigram.

The epigrams of Martial have a special value to those who can see, as
Renaissance readers did, the beauty of things “writ small.” Appreciation
of the form captures the paradoxical nature of the genre itself: trifling yet
belabored, small yet of great value, constrained yet extravagant, like a
gem. These three commentaries of the early seventeenth century can
contribute to the critical interpretation of Martial in the Renaissance, and
as such can be of use to future commentators of Martial and students of
the Renaissance.
