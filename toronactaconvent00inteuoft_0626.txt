602 COWLEY'S ANACREONTIQUES

And let us chearfully awhile,
Like the Wine and Roses smile. (1-4)

But it is not just translators and editors who influence Cowley's Anacre-
ontiques. A number of the anacreontea had been turned in the sixteenth
century into epigram5‚ which in turn had been attached to the illustrations
of the Renaissance emblem books and so had entered the emblem tradi-
tion. Two of these, the first by Sambucus, the second by Alciati, may have
inssuenced Cowley's renderings of “Beauty’' and “The Swallow.” When an
anacreontic becomes an epigram, its point is often sharpened in order to
illustrate the moral maxim of the emblem it illustrates. Both Sambucus
and Alciati shorten the anacreontic they imitate and make it deliver a swift
epigrammatical thrust. In the emblem, “Pulchritudo vincit'’ (Beauty
conquers), Sambucus pictures a woman in the foreground supported by a
Cupid; in the background the diverse animab—horse, lion, hare, fish,
bird—whom nature has supplied with defenses appear. Sambucus closely
follows the Greek anacreontic in the first six lines; in the final six he
diverges3 omitting any reference of nature's gift of wisdom to man, he
proceeds immediately to woman:

Concessit at loco horum
Formam, placere possit.
Qua, vincere 8c seueros
Ignes, acuta tela

Tantum potest venustas.¹⁵

So [Nature] conceded to them [Women]
Beauty in its place, by which

It is possible both to please

And to conquer raging fire and sharp weapons,
Such great power had Beauty.

The shift in emphasis is small, but telling. The epigram makes the general-
ization that the anacreontic only implies—that beauty has the power both
to please and to conquer. The epigrammatist even manages to make
(venustas) the final word in his poem.

Cowley in “Beauty'’ follows the epigrammatical tradition and reworks
the nine lines of his anacreontic to express a generalizing moral and to
extend that moral to a witty observation not in the original Greek. First of
all, Cowley makes Beauty both arms and armor:
