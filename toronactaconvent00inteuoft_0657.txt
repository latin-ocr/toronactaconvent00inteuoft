scenes, mostly from animal life, with a moralizing applicatiom story and
application usually not running to more than ten or twenty lines.

Τὴο fables of the Aesopus-Phaedrus tradition were known to the Middle
Ages from the so-oelled Romulus-collection, a prose version dating,
according to some, from late antiquity, according to others, from some-
where between the tenth and twelfth centuries.⁸ They were also known
through the distichs of the Anonymus Neveleti, identified later with
Gualterus Anglicus, from the twelfth century. In 1465 Perotti gave an
epitome of the Phaedrus-fables and thirty others, these last known as the
Appendix Pemttina.

The groet number of extant manuscripts shows that the spread of Avia·
nus's fables must have been enormous in the Middle Ages. Owing to their
simple metre and their rather tame spirit in comparison to Phaedrus's fables,
they were used as schooltexts from a very early date on. Their influence on
mediaeval fables wn'tten in hexameters of elegiae distichs was great.

Further development of the fable in the Middle Ages brings into exis-
tence, on the one hand, the animal epic, like the Roman de Rerum and the
Ysengrimus, which criticises contemporary society and contains strong ele-
ments of allegory and pamble. On the other hand, the traditional fable lives
on and is used in sermons, where it becomes, in accordance with the system
of biblical exegesis developed by Origenes, a sig-num or significatio that can be
interpreted in many kinds of ways, mystice, spiritualiter etc.

Between 1476 and 1480, so more than ten years before Bartholomaeus
Coloniensis’s fables appeared in pn'nt, Heinrich Steinhowel published his
fable-collection.⁹ It contained a biography of Aesopus by Planudes, the
Latin prose-text of the Romulus-collection with a German translation, the
Latin distichs of the Anonymus Neveleti and some prose-fables by Petrus
Alphonsi and Poggio. Another famous collection of fables, that of Marti-
nus Dorpius, a Louvain professor of Divinity, appeared about thirty years
later.¹⁰ In between Bartholomaeus published his two fables.
