692 MARTIAL IN THE RENAISSANCE

Jesuit Matthias Rader which he put through three editions from 1601 to
1628. These remained popular, being reprinted as late as 1784. 1 quote
from the 1000-page third edition of 1627.8 Finally there is the three·
volume 1619 edition of Peter Scriverius with its composite commentary.⁹

Friedlaender praised the text of Scriverius but took no notice of the
n‘ch prefatory material and commentary.¹⁰ Further, the Ramirez and
Rader have been lost to classicists since Friedlaender dismissed them as
“out-of-date'’ (“veraltet'’)¹¹—out-of-date‚ I believe, for their image of
Martial as a doctus poeta, one who had achieved perfectiori in art through
diligent study of the best models; out-of-date for asserting the connection
between poetry and learning that is implicit in their readings; out-of-date
at a time when a preference for originality denied imitation as a creative
endeavor, mistook it instead for copying, and in the process divorced
succeeding scholarly generations from the tradition in whose preservation
these humanists saw the beginning and end of their work.

Lorenzo Ramirez de Prado (1583-1658) was born into a noble Spanish
family. There has been some controversy over the authorship of the
Hypomnemata, which has also at times been attributed to Baltasar de
Cespedes, the famed grammarian and the young Ramirez's professor at
the University of Salamanca.¹² Both the circumstances of the work's
publication and its brash criticisms of Joseph Scaliger, Justus Lipsius, and
Janus Gruter placed Ramirez in numerous hot controversies with many,
including ultimately the Spanish authorities. His later public life was
devoted to law, politics, and diplomacy, including appointment in 1626 to
the Office of the Inquisition. The catalogue of his personal library shows
Ramirez to have been a man equally devoted in private to letters, and one
who maintained a life-long interest in Martial. He owned virtually every
important Martial commentary‚ including the 1619 Scriverius and the 1627

Rader.¹³
