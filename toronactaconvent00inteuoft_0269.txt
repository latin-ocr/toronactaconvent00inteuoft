is not theft, if anyone steals anything from a gentile.

UBERIUS: A pious opinion indeed!

ELEAZER: Hence it is that many of our people get rich so suddenly.
For us profit arises in two thousand ways: by laW, by injury, by theft‚
fraud, deceit, perjury, everywhere. But for you who live by justice
and goodness there is only one way of acquiring goods.

TIBERIUS: Now he is speaking the truth. Wickedness is profitable,
while poverty companions probity. Rarely does a good man get rich.
ELEAZER: And so having from boyhood embraced my father's cus-

dealings. My grandfather and my father bequeathed me two very
rich farms, usury and kidnapping. I tilled them with all eagerness
and industry. If any other little profit offered itself, I scraped it
together along the way.

TIBERIUSz How good for the state that there are so many farmers of

in the crowd hovering like a kite looking for prey. If any good-
looking boy wandered unattended‚ I lured him with caresses and
sweets and took him home quickly. Soon Ι would carry him abroad
and sell him for a lot of money. This was my treasury, this unimped-
ed road, if I had not now been caught, was leading me to wealth.

1650s Cromwell proposed readmitting Jews to England.

Although there are few phrases which uniquely link Paria and The Comedy
os Errors, the influence of this early comedy of Shakespeare is, as one
might expect, pervasive. Vincent, like Shakespeare, moves his comedy
from Plautine or Italian slapstick to resonant questions of identity uncom-
fortably near trag-ic. All Vincent’s young lovers—and, indeed, their par-
ents—suffer, but Fulvius, perhaps at once the most capable and the most
innocent, wins our sympathy when immediately after repudiating his
unrecognized mother, he prays for the wisdom of Oedipus to unravel the
enigma in which he is emotionally and intellectually ensnared:
