ing face, the Titanic Sun and the stars are all strengthened by Spirit
working within them, and by Mind, which is blended into all the vast

universe and pervades every part of it, enlivening the whole mass.¹⁸

The creative functions of Virgil’s Spiritus and Mens are thus reclaimed for
the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. There are many other such trans-
formations: the sun is Phoebus, the ocean Amphritite, and Satan becomes
“Tartareus tyrannus.'’ This is typical of the way Wilson sets the two inhen'-
tances in a dynamic relation, the scriptural core of the Commentario set off
and heightened by classical resources of diction, mythology and literary
allusion.

Discussions of the imitatio debate, particularly with reference to the
Ciceronianus, tend to assume too sharp a dichotomy between the diachron-
ic Erasmians and the synchronic purists. It is important to note that
Wilson's aim is reconciliation: at the conclusion of the De Animi Tranquilli·
tate he attacks those who are displeased “si desint Thespiades, Ioves,
Veneres, Ledae, 8c fabulosa id genus Graecorum commenta’' (p. 392). His
ode, modelled on Horace but focussed on Christ crucified, is sung to the
lyre as a Christian replacement. Erasmus might deplore his confusion of
God and Jupiter but Wilson in turn criticises Erasmus for his neglect of
“puritas Romani sermonis” (that “Romani‘’ is a revealing emphasis). In
fact Wilson’s classicizing habit and his preferred themes-awe before
creation, the dignity of man, the cross of Christ—are what one would
expect in the Lyonnais circle. The one constant inssuence for them in
Paris and then later in Lyons had been Guillaume Bude and it is in the De
Asse and, in particular, the De Transitu that we can find a precedent for
just this kind of syncretism.

In a recent discussion of the Ciceronianus debate Thomas M. Greene
picks on what he terms “the classical synchronism’' of Bembo, Vida and
Scaliger as an evasion of a painful present, the Italy of foreign inva-
sions.¹⁹ In the case of the Lyonnais group it is the religious situation that
seems definitive: their syncretism handles devotional themes in a linguistic
code which evades not only scholastic associations but even scholastic
· precision. That a work such as the De Animi Tranquillitate‚ which opens
with the news of Ochino’s and Vermigli's ssight from the Inquisifion,
should end with the singing of a Christian-Horatian ode on peace of mind
