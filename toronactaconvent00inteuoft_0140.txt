of the New Testament with its prolegomena recommending language
studies had aroused a great deal of indignation among conservative
theolog-lans. Erasmus had boldly revised the text of the Vulgate, correcting
not only textual corruptions and mistranslations but also grammar and
style.³ Defending such emendations, he argued that “many people re-
coiled from the holy books because of their unpolished, not to say,
unkempt style'’ (LB VI fol. *²⁸3 verso).* He pleaded the case of scholarly
readers: “If we simplify our language for the benefit of ignorant and
simple folk, should we not help educated readers too by purifying the
language?'' (CWE Ep. 843238-40). The time was ripe, he said, to render
the New Testament puro castoque sermone. This phrase obviously piqued
Masson who mimicked Erasmus' concern for stylistic purity in his descrip-
tion of the pedant. In the prolegomena to the New Testament edi-
tion—especially in the Methodus later enlarged and published separately
under the title Ratio verae theologiae—Erasmus encouraged students of
theology to study languageS. Like the pedant criticized by Masson, he
claimed that “language studies . . . gave us the distinguished theologians of
old'’ (Holborn Ratio 190217). Borrowing a metaphor from Jerome, he
called philology the handmaid of Queen Theology. This pedissequa was
lowly, but indispensable.‘¹

Conservative theologiam, however, rejected Erasmus' notions of a
theologia rhetorica. Noel Beda, one of Erasmus’ most relentless critics at the
faculty of theology in Paris, saw Erasmus as nothing but a meddling
humanist. The humanistae theologizantes, as he called them contemptuously,
wished to subject Holy Writ to the same criteria as secular writings, but
Scripture was above literary criticism.⁵ Many conservative theologians
shared Beda’s opinion. Erasmus‘ effort to improve the style of the Vulgate
was accordingly met by a chorus of protest: The word of God must not be
subjected to the rules of Donatus; elegance must not become an issue in
sacred writings; “God was not offended by solecisms.’'⁶ As the Spanish
