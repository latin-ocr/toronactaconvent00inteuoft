Plautus and Terence, where many characters show a more realistic mix of
virtues and vices. From a post-classical, Christian perspective, certainly, the
moral utility of ancient comedy, with its conspicuous indulgence towards
young men’s love affairs, might seem questionable. It was in this regard
that Hroswitha claimed superiority for her plays over those of Terence,
and some Renaissance authors use the prologue to do the same: Zovitius,
for instance, marshalling all possible arguments claims that Ruth is a more
useful character than the heroines of Plautus and Terence, because she is
more virtuous. Sixt Birck goes further, and in a witty prologue of the
controversia] type uses the criterion of moral excellence to show that his
play Susanna is more useful not only than ancient comedy but also than its
recent predecessors in the genre.

In this area, then, although employing a topos foreign to the classical
prologue, typically the author is using the prologue to advertise conformi-
ty with well-established classical values. If he claims to surpass classical
models, that too is an ancient commonplace. A second criterion of excel-
lence with sometimes appears in the prologue has a much more oblique
relation to classical precepts and models. Donatus quotes Cicero for the
opinion that comedy is “imitatio vitae, speculum consuetudinis, imago
veritatis.”¹² This was a favourite passage among our authors, and will
very likely have been the starn'ng-point for the claim in some prologues
that the play offers not only usefulness but truth.¹³ For Cicero, presum-
ably, “truth” meant something like “realism‚'’ things as they generally are;
but in a Christian context it has quite other associations, and in this area
authors move by and large from being sels-consciously “classical'' to being
equally self-consciously “Chfistian.” At its simplest level, the stories of
Susanna and Joseph may be perceived as true, in comparison with the
parallel classical story of Hippolytus, because being related in scripture
they are historical events—and thus, to become less simple, God's creation,
not man’s.¹⁴ When, as frequently, it is a parable which is dramatised, this

¹³ The clearest example is the prologue to Joseph, lines 6-9:

apporto namque non Plauti aut Terenti
quas esse fictas nostis omnes fabulas,

vanas, prophanas, ludicras ac lubricas:
verum veram sacramque porto et seriam. . . .

¹⁴ Thus Crocus contrasts the fabulae of Plautus and Terence with the historia of
Joseph (Joseph, prologue lines 15—20: note the reference to Donatus’ quotation from
Cicero in the phrase vitae speculum, and the conclusive summingvp ne quid maius
