758 ERASMUS AND AURELIUS

which he states in the epigram that it appeared outside his own region. He
does this not only in the poem dedicated to George van Scheveningen,
rector of the Hieronymus convent of Delft, and to Gerard Bartoldszn. van
Noortwijk, the sexton of the house. Also in 1524, in a letter to the famous
Sacramentarian Cornelis Hoen, he refers to the last book of the Vita
Hieronymi “a me edito.''⁷ As Rizzo showed in her book Il lessico filologico
degli umanisti the Italian humanists of the quattrocento tried to prove that
their manuscript works were of the same value and importance as the
printed editions of their colleagues and that for this reason they applied
terms like “editio’' to a manusclipt.⁸ In the Dutch respublica litteraria at
the time of Aurelius we find a similar attitude.

The stress of Aurelius on the Vita Jheronimi as an “editio'' becomes
even more significant when we consider the fact that there was some
competition on his part to get his Vita published before that of Erasmus
came out. On the first of July 1516 the greatest Aurelius-admirer ever to
live, namely Alardus of Amsterdam, professor of theology at the Louvain
university, wrote to Erasmus, who was perhaps already at Louvain: “Please
do not fail to give as much work as you can to assist the efforts which your
friend Cornelis has expended on Jerome.''⁹ These words are interesting
because they suggest in the first place that Aurelius had already finished
his Vita jheronimi byJuly 1516, and in the second place that Erasmus knew
about this work. To verify this last point we have to see whether there is
possibly some textual relationship between the two Vitae.¹⁰ For that 1
have chosen a few passages from both Vitae to compare.

First I will take a closer look at the passage which both authors devote
to the patria of Jerome, the place where he was born and the question
whether this was already at that time a part of Italy. Under the heading
nativitas Erasmus gives a short exposition:

Natus est igitur vir eximius Hieronymus, . . . in oppido Stridonis‚
quodiam tum a Gothis omnia populantibus eversum fuisse, testis est
