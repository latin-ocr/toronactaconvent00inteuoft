ter).¹⁶ He then continues his transcription of letters, with numerous
abridgements, over some 15 pages, arriving at a total of 69 letters attn'bu·
ted to Jean de Pins. In reality, only 68 of those letters can be attributed to
our humanist, as one of them (no. 17) was written by a brother-probably
Jean de Montbrun-and then forwarded to senator Jean seguier of Tou-
louse, as evidence that he and his family were diligently protecting their
friend’s property from the ravages of unruly mercenary troups. Yet con-
trary to what we might be led to believe through Graverol's previous state·
ment and his marginal note at the end of letter no. 53, several of the
remaining 16 letters are not necessarily abridged. Letter no. 60, addressed
to pope Clement V11‚¹⁷ does not appear to have been truncated, proba·
bly because it was sufficiently interesting, or sufficiently brief, that Gra-
verol was willing to copy it from beginning to end. Four other letters show
no sign of abridgement: no. 61, an undated letter to Erasmus, no. 62 ad-
dressed to Pierre Gylli, prior of Durenque, no. 64 to the highly respected
first president of the Parliament of Toulouse,Jacques Minut, and no. 68
to the Supreme Pontiff Adrian VI.¹⁸ It therefore appears that the first
section of the manuscript contains, in fact, not 53 complete letters, but 58.
Clearly eleven of the first 69 letters were abridged by Graverol.¹⁹ We can
assume that he had grown tired of this tedious labor, or else had simply
lacked the time necessary for completing his work with all due attention.

If we take a closer look at one formal aspect of these letters, it becomes
clear that Jean de Pins is at least in one sense a true Ciceronian: chrono-
logical considerations are of little importance in the collection. A great
majority of the 69 letters or extracts of letters copied by Graverol are
incompletely dated, or contain no date at all. Forty·five are without any

¹⁶ Ibid„ fol. 164r (p. 47 of the Pinus collection).

¹⁷ Although the name of this pope is not indicated in the address, and no date
appears in the letter, comte J. de Pins has tentatively placed this papal missive in 1525,
during the papacy of Clement VII. See Revue d’Histoire Diplomatique 62 (1948): 111-13.
The bishop of Rieux is considered to have contributed to the ratifioetion of the Truce
of Toledo, of August 11, 1525.

¹⁸ Although undated, this letter “Ad Pontificem Maximum” contains what may be
interpreted as references to de Pins’ future legation to the Conference of Verona
(winter of 1519-1520). We can therefore ascribe it to the months preceding November
1519, during the papacy of Adn'an VII.

¹⁹ Those letters are nos. 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 63, 65, 66, 67, 69. At the end of no.
63, Graverol notes a very brief excerpt from yet another letter not contained in the
manuscript: ⁴⁸. . .huic cruentae et sanguinariae belluae, sub cuius impotenti dominatu

et imperio vivimus. . . .” The transcribet does not mention the name of the addressee
or the date this brief excerpt was written.
