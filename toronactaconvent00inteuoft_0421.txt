endowed with free movement in the void, since this too is necessary for
creation. Polignac will attack each of these points in turn3 the system, he
assures Quintus, is so much stage-sceneryr, looked at from the rear stalls it
gives the appearance of truth; once back-stage the illusion is destroyed; the
nappings and machinery are laid bare, and the whole is seen for what it is:

Nil praeter telasque leves leviterque perunctas
Cernis, et avulso ruit omnis machina clavo (103-4).

A. Limitations of atoms in power and number.
l. 111-181-The atom does not exist perse:

(a) Nothing can be said to exist independently unless it is unlimited in
every way; but the atom, far from being completely unlimited, lacks
some of the powers which even dependent creatures possess, e.g.,
mind; therefore, the atom does not exist in its own right.

(b) The existence of the atom is not necessary: the loss of a single atom
does not affect the secun‘ty of the world as a whole3 it can be replaced
by void; but if a single atom is dispensable, why not two or four or all
atoms? Once you admit an immense void, there is no need for atoms;
matter becomes a stranger to the world. Why then is it to be consid-
ered infinite and independent?

2. 182-284—The atoms are not infinite in number:

(a) Thtt Epicureans posit an infinite void which is larger than the whole
mass of atoms; the number of atoms is thereby limited and cannot also
be infinite.

(b) Since there are not enough atoms to fill the void, there is room for
matter to be increased; but if it can be increased it must now be limited.
Moreover‚ if matter can be increased, it can also be decreased; but
whatever can be increased or decreased by parts being added or taken
away cannot be called infinite.

(c) Each atom is itself finite and no total of finite units can make an
infinite; it will either be possible to add one further unit to the total or

atoms‚ as they rush at the outer rim, serve to prevent the disintegration of the world
by their blows; but an infinite supply of them is needed if the succession of blows is
to bc maintained (1042-51). For analysis of the entire section see C. Bailey, Titi Lucreti
Cari: De Rerum Natura, 3 vols. (Oxford, 1947), 2:772-77. We may note that the infinity
of atoms is rejected by Gassendi (Animadversiones in Decimum Librum Diogenis Laeuii,
