258 CREATING HUMANIST MYTHS

Greifswald to Frankfurt an der Oder. From there he turns to Vienna,
Ingolstadt, Nuremberg, Leipzig, and Erfurt. Meissen, Franconia, Augs-
burg, and Tiibingen are the next stages. Schlauraff then travels to Strass-
burg, Schlettstadt, Hagenau, Freiburg, Basel, and Worms. Via Mainz he
returns home to Cologne. Compared with the trip from the Querelae, the
itinerary in this case includes Vienna and the important imperial cities of
Augsburg and Nuremberg as well as Ingolstadt. In southwest Germany
Basel, Schlettstadt, and Hagenau are added.

Wherever this “cursor in theologia,'' as Schlauraff is called, turns, he is
met with a hostile reception by the humanists. He is insulted‚ mocked,
ridiculed, publicly embarrassed, and threatened. In Leipzig, for instance,
Petrus Mosellanus urges his students to hang him, in Erfurt Eobanus
Hessus threatens to knock his teeth out, and in Franconia Hutten himself
vows to beat him with a stick, should he decide to stay. In addition to the
threats Schlauraff also suffers physical injury. Spurred on by their teach-
ers, Spalatin and AesticampianuS, students beat him up and pull him by
his hair. As if this were not enough, the unlucky cursor is slapped in the
face by Johannes Sturnus (line 80) and thrown down the stairs by Stor-
chius (line 119). Even otherwise mild-mannered humanists like Beatus
Rhenanus and Wolfgang Angst are caught up in their anger: Rhenanus
hits the unfortunate Schlauraff over the head, while Wolfgang Angst pokes
him with a stick in the eyeS‚ and Johannes Setzer, the printer from Hage-
nau uses the fruit of his professional labors, a thick folio, to hit the
fearless Anti-Reuchlinist so strongly in the side that he loses his wind (line
122). In Worms the physician Theobaldus temporarily forgets the oath of
Hippocrates and instead of healing Schlauraff hits him hard on the head,
a blow that results in a bump the size of a cheese.¹³ Thoroughly intimi-
dated Schlauraff retreats to Mainz only to be hit over the head once again,
this time with a stool, by Huttichius‚ one of the members of the notorious
“Kronengesellschaft,‘’ that circle of humanist friends who regularly met in
the inn called “Zur Krone.'' Johann Konigstein pushes him down the
stairs, and Thomas Murner, whom he meets strolling along the Main, is
only restrained by his professorial dignity from throwing Schlauraff into
the cool waters of the river. Exhausted by so much verbal and physical
abuse, Schlauraff returns to Cologne where he finds a congenial company
of theologians.¹⁴
