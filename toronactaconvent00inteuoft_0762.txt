736 LATIN EPIGRAMS ΟΝ ETIENNE DOLET

epigram carries throughout the seeds of its own ineluctable conclusion,
the life of Dolet prepares the end: the rootless youth, the precarious
livelihood, the defiance of the system, the disparagement of privileged but
untalented colleagues, the unbridled love of intellectual freedom in a
society which limited its exercise, the idealism which ultimately would not
bow to expediency—these characteristics stirred friend and foe into action
and, ultimately, into action which cost Dolet his life. His life and his death
were an epigram: doubtless subconsciously‚ his contemporaries discerned
just how apposite the epigram is as a vehicle for their verdicts upon him.
