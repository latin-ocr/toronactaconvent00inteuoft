from Poggio to Grotius, which reflect its sense of language as a socia]
medium rather than a container for abstract truths.⁸ A closer look at the
career of Florens Wilson may clarify this point,

A striking feature of that career is the way in which Wilson’s move-
ments provide a series of links between religious episodes or factions
usually treated in isolation. After his education in Scotland, where he had
been born around 1504, Wilson appears as tutor to Wolsey’s son, Thomas
Wynter, in 1528. This brought him into some intimacy with the architects
of the Henrician schism, in particular Cromwell, Gardiner and that other
apologist for royal supremacy Thomas Starkey. At the same time, since
Wynter was resident in Paris, Wilson gained the notice of the French
supporters of moderate reform such as Guillaume and Jean de Bellay,
while his Psalmi quintidecimi enarratio of 1531 was dedicated to the Cardi-
nal of Lon-aine? Such associations may seem pn’marily political, but the
display of Hebrew in this book and in the In Psalmum quinquaginta enar-
ratio, dedicated to Gardiner in the following year, can be taken as a
gesture of alignment in the fierce dispute over the foundation of the
trilingual College Royale. In 1535 Wilson spent some time with Sadoleto
in Carpentras (following the recommendation of Starkey) and by 1538 he
was settled in Lyons where he taught at the College de la Trinite, an
institution with marked evangelical tendencies2¹⁰ He also worked for
Gryphius, the most extensive printer of Erasmus’s works in France, and
was part of a remarkable group of Neo-Latin poets which included Gilbert
Ducher, Bourbon (by this time another “Cromwellian'’), Vulteius, Macrin
and Dolet.¹¹ This Lyons circle was highly ambivalent in its confessional

Psalmi quintilia-imi enarratio (Pax-is: L. Cynaeus, 1531). Wilson reveals in the dedication
that he had been introduced to Lorraine by Guillaume du Bellay and Sir Francis
Bryan, the English ambassador.

Ad Florentium Volusenum

Auxilii cupiens, erecta mente levavi
In montes oculos terque, quaterque meos.

Sed solum a Domino auxilium, Volusene, videbam,
Qui nulla solus cuncta creavit ope.

Sedulos hic custos nunquam dormitet, ut errans
Huc illuc pedibus commoveare tuis.
