ECKHARD BERNSTEIN 259

Whereas the tenth elegy of the second book of the Quemlae offers
sparkling gems of deft characterization, Schlauraff’s “Carmen rithmicale”
lacks such mini-portraits. This lack is quite understandable from the
fiction of the poem, which like all the letters of the EOV is intended to
demonstrate through sels—revelation the ignorance, complacency, and
narrow-mindedness of the scholastics. A precise knowledge of the individ-
ual achievements of the humanists would understandably have under·
mined this principle. For that reason Pirckheimer is referred toxas a
“quidam Pirckheymer’' (line 40), the famous Freiburg jurist Ulrich Zasius
as “unus vetulus qui vocatur Zasius'’ (line 135), and Erasmus a certain
man “qui Erasmus dictur'' (line 143). If details are mentioned, they are
irrelevant gossip: of Georg Sibutus we learn that he “habet antiquam
vetulam, que vendit bonam Cerevisiam'' (line 8), and the only observation
worthy of comment about Jakob Wimpfeling is that he wears “unum
pellicium quod est bene impinguatum’' (line 112). Schlauraff himself has
only contempt for these “heretics,” as he calls the humanists, while he
himself is deeply steeped in the traditions of the Church and the ossified
practices of the late medieval university.

Initially the controversy between the Cologne Dominicans and Reuchlin
might have been, as has been suggested by Overfield‚¹⁵ a quarrel about
the use of Jewish books. By 1514, however, it had developed into a cause
ce'lbbre, a showdown between humanism and scholasticism. Responsible for
that change was above all Hutten, who had finally found an enemy worthy
of his pen. Whereas in the Querelae the enemy had been a relatively
unknown law professor, Henning Lotz, the opponent now was quite
impressive: the university establishment, 200 years of outdated traditions
of a rigid and arid philosophy and a monolithic church with the powerful
instruments of intimidation and suppression. For Hutten, at least, the
battle lines were clearly drawn: on the one hand were the progressive
humanists, on the other the backward-looking theologians and scholastics.

Alexander von der Osten, Rhagius Aesticampianus, Johannes Sturnus, Johannes
Reuchlin, Heinrich Bebel, jakob wimpfeling, Wolfgang Angst‚ Sebastian Erant, and
Georg Spalatin), there are a number of interesting additions: new are the well known
Viennese Humanists‚Joachim Vadianus and Johann Cuspinian, as well as the Nurem-
berger willibald Pirckheimer, the Englishman Richard Crocus, the Augsburg Human-
ist Conrad Peutinger, and the philological “wunderkind” from Tfibingen‚ Philipp
Melanchthon. New is also Erasmus of Rotterdam, who since his triumphal tour up the
Rhine in 1514 had been regarded as a German Humanist, as well as Thomas Murner
who had endeared himself to the Humanists because of his own quarrels with the
Dominicans. New finally are two Cologne Humanists‚Johann Caesarius and Hermann
von Neuenaar.
