models, except for line 26 where the Fall of Man is mentioned, but in
decent classical attire. Line 23 contains a formula from Roman religion,
well-known from Horace's third Roman ode, and lines 23-24 use a topos
from Hellenistic funeral epigrams as we know them from the 7th book of
the Greek Anthology. Line 25 has taken its metaphor from the Roman
circus, and lines 27-29 are pure Stoicism; especially verse 29 suggests
phrases from Seneca on the topic of cotidie mori.⁷ Prepare your death, let
it not overtake you unexpectedly, is the message. Christian notions of sin,
repentance and redemption do not occur at all in this last stanza‚ except
that they might be said to be included in the final allusion to the artes
moriendi, handbooks on how to die piously.8 The stanza’s fusion of pagan
and Christian lets classical antiquity prevail—not only in the form, but also
very much in the content. Notice how elegantly the rhythm moves towards
the end: throughout the poem there has been a quiet, dignified movement
with each distich as a well-rounded whole, properly divided into two
halves. But in the very last distich the twofold pattern is cut into three,
giving a staccato effect and a feeling of a compact mass of ideas being
squeezed into a minimum of space, making the three dogmas stand out
sharply.

The corresponding Danish stanza contains the prayer that the tomb
may remain undisturbed‚ and the stress on death as a general condition,
common to all human beings. There is no Greek Anthology, no Roman
circus, no Stoicism, no handbook on dying, nor any Adam biting the fatal
apple. Instead, there is an appeal that the readers may mend their ways in
time and pray God for mercy. This is the only point where the Danish
version has something that the Latin one lacks. The stanza is hymn-like,
close in tone to many of the poems in the new Danish hymnal by Hans
Thommison‚ published 1569.

As a whole, the Danish version is no uninteresting poem either, only
very different from the Latin one. It is not as compact as its counterpart
and it makes no efforts to cram all the topics of the Latin poem into its
more limited space. On the contrary, it takes its time, leaves out what does
not find room, and has a simple and natural ssow. It is much more pious,
but by no means sels-effacing; apart from its affinities to hymns, I think it
