798 JESUIT DRAMA

land's history.¹⁷ England had been christianized comparatively early but
then, in the reign of King Henry VIII, it established the Church of Eng-
land and rejected the pope as head of the Catholic church. There can be
little doubt that theJesuits carefully observed all developments in this lost
province, as they, at least secretly, hoped to win it back for Roman Cathol-
icism. Moreover, in times of religious struggles, the Jesuits searched for
historical situations in which the conflict between spiritual and secular
power had been fought οιιῐ.18 In addition, they tried to find historical
characters whose fates could be used as examples in teaching pupils and
their parents to find answers to their everyday problems. British history
proved to be a rich source of material for their purposes: it provided
negative or ideal heroes as well as conflicts between sacerdotium and
imperium or the popular conversion-tales.

The above arguments may be considered a satisfactory explanation of
the Jesuits' general interest in English, Irish, or Scottish history, but they
are not a convincing reason for the extraordinary popularity of a small
group of plays which stand in sharp contrast to the large number of
subjects only dealt with occasionally.

Therefore‚ I should like to point out a few characteristics of the repeat-
edly staged plays and to illustrate why Thomas More played such an
eminent role in Jesuit drama.

The dramas under discussion can be divided into two major groups.
The plays on Saint Edmund, Edward the Confessor, and Saint Patrick
clearly revolve around a positive hero. The rest deal with historical events
that had aroused great interest on the continent. Moreover, due to the
intrigues of a number of negative heroes, they share a conflict-structure
which reaches its climax in the death of the protagonist, be it Thomas
More, Mary Stuart, Charles 1, or Thomas Becket.

The christianization of foreign countries and the involved risks had at
all times been very popular with the Jesuits. No wonder they wrote plays
about Saint Patrick, who, equipped with the ability to perform miracles,
succeeded in converting the Irish at the beginning of the fifth century.
There can be little doubt that this wonder-working, which reached its
climax in his opening of the gate to hell, and which could be presented in
a most horrifying way on the well-equipped stages, very much appealed to
