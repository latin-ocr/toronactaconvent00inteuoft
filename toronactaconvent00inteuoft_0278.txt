254 CREATING HUMANIST MYTHs

psychological context and therefore also fails to appreciate the contribution
Hutten made to the creation of a humanist group-identity. The significance
of the Quemlae, and especially that of the poem “Ad poetas Gennanos,” with
its prominent position at the end, becomes clear only fully when we briefly
recall Hutten's biography.⁷ In 1499 his parents had sent the eleven year old
boy to the cathedral school of the famous abbey in Fulda to prepare him for
a career in the higher ecclesiastical hierarchy, a career which was open only
to members of the nobility. Against the will of his parents, however, and
to their great disappointment, the young Hutten left the school in 1505 or
possibly earlier.⁸ Instead of settling down to a comfortable life as a
churchman, he began the restless life as a student, wandering in the next
few years from university to university. By the time Hutten arrived in
Rostock in 1510 and wrote Querelae, he had studied in Cologne, Erfurt,
Frankfurt an der Oder, Leipzig and Greifswald. It was during that time
that he became more and more attracted to that intellectual and literary
movement which we now call humanism. He had begun writing Latin
poetry, had followed his humanist teachers and had made many contacts
with those who shared his interest in and fascination for the studia huma·
nitatis. In applying himself so enthusiastically to these studies he had,
however, not only crossed the plans of his ambitious father but had also
broken with the traditions of the knights who in general did not belong
to the humanist-intellectual elite of Germany.⁹

Seen from this perspective, Hutten's Querelae, and especially the last
poem, begin to make much more sense. Having de facto rejected the
traditions of the knightly class, Hutten sought a new identity in the “res
publica litteraria” of the humanists. Up to this point, however, Hutten had
published only five minor poems totaling a modest 164 lines.¹⁰ With the
writing of the Querelae, a substantial work by its very length· and quality,
Hutten hoped to provide the “entry ticket'’ to the humanist circle. If then
the Querelae as a whole were meant as a journeyman’s piece to gain entry
into the humanist guild, the poem “Ad poetas Germanos” more specifica}-
ly was meant to demonstrate not only the impressive number of the
