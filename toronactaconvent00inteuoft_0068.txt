54 LATIN IN 16TH·CENTURY DANISH CULTURE

Denmark's long history and powerful status in former times. Christian
Pedersen had also made the first translation of the New Testament into
Danish‚ published a Latin-Danish vocabulary, and argued—in print and in
Danish—for Latin as the teaching language of the schools in order that the
young students should be able to participate in the international scholarly
discussions on a par with others.¹² In the decades leading up to the
Lutheran Reformation‚ Danish had been in frequent use as the written
language for the discussions carried on between Catholics and Protestants
while at the same time appealing to a much broader audience. But when
after the Reformation a ramified and centralized system of schools was
instituted, it was decided to use Latin as the teaching language for the
same reason as that put forward by Christian Pedersen: young Danes
should not be handicapped in their careers in the world of learning. Thus
for nationalistic reasons, Danish lost ground to Latin. Books were still
published in Danish‚ but mainly such in which well-educated authors
talked down to their readers. When they wrote for their equals, in Den-
mark or abroad, they wrote Latin.13

A comprehensive study of Danish wedding poetry from the sixteenth
century has recently been made. The total list is of 79 items‚ all after 1540.
There are 72 in Latin, 5 in Danish, and 2 in Greek. Here no doubt there
was more prestige attached to Latin—or even Greek—than to Danish, and
it was therefore more honourable to receive an epithalamium in Latin
than in Danish. Even so, the dominance of Latin is remarkable.¹⁴

Texts from the last decades of the sixteenth century often give the
impression that the authors find it easier to express themselves in Latin
than in Danish. Latin was the language in which they had been trained,
from the very moment when they had started to learn their letters; they
had had its orthography and grammar inculcated and been taught the

¹³ Erik Dal has made a statistical study of the choice of languages in Danish books:
“Biicher in danischer Sprache vor 1600,” GutenbergJahrbuch 62 (1987): 37-46, showing
that Danish was in fact the language of the majority of printed books. Tne investiga·
tion does not, however, show the varying importance of the books concerned, nor the
ups and downs during the century. It is interesting to compare the situation in 1580
to that in 1530: Lauritz Nielsen's bibliography has 12 titles from 1530 with 10 in
Danish and 2 in Latin, whereas for 1580 it has 29, 14 in Danish and 15 in Latin.
