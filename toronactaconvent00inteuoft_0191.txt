intervention‚ approval or disapproval. When after the ἀναγνῶρισις he tries
to justify his vow by referring to the victory that God has accorded him (v,
1164), he gives a personal account of the events, just as the daughter’s
point of vieW, viz„ that she dies as an expiatory offering for her people, is
a noble but strictly human belief.

The mother, Storge‚ like the other main characters, does not have a
consistent, psychologically developed personality. She expresses a limited
range of ideas and emotions. Her role is very important: she pronounces
the first words of the play, after the prologue, and the last ones. In the
first and final episodes it is her part to express her love for her daughter
and the sorrow caused by the latter’s horrible death. In the closing epi-
sode the lines regarding her allude to the mother of Christ at the foot of
the cross, when the people consecrate her in the words: “feminam unam
beatam maxime et miserrimam” (vv, 1441-42): the poet is clearly alluding
to the “mater pia, fons amoris.” No doubt he chose her Greek name
Stmge deliberately, as a translation of Pietas.

The character of the daughter Iphis, too, presents some fluctuations,
but towards the end of the play she assumes the traits of the suffering
Christ, as later poets, theologians and modern cn‘tics have not failed to
observe. 1 presume that Buchanan took her name from the story in Ovid’s
Metamorphoses (11.669-797), in which a girl Iphis is brought up by her
mother disguised as a boy; but when her father is about to marry her off
to a girl, she is changed into a boy by the goddess Isis in the nick of time.
I take it that Buchanan wanted to refer to this story precisely on this
account. Twice Iphis’s “animus virilis” (vv, 1333, 1410) is praised; she is
called a “virago” (ν. 1395); in connection with Iphis, the last choral ode
makes an allusion to Joan of Arc, who, as Walsh has observed‚ put on
men‘s clothing before being put to the stake.³ Before and after Buchanan,
scholars and poets liked to view the story of jephthah and his daughter as
a prefiguration of the expiatory sacrifice of Christ (Iephthah [= Christ]
offering his earthly life [= his daughter]),⁴ but in Buchanan’s play, so it

Humanistica Lovaniensia 31 (1982); 120-40, esp. 132, 134. From 3 poetioel point of
view it makes a great difference whether the poet alludes to the Sacrifice of Christ
within the drama itself, making it thus in some degree allegorial, as Buchanan has
done, or in a dedimtory poem only, as is the case in Vondel’sJeptlm.
