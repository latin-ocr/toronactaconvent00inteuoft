The Deventer manuscript bears the title Vita gloriosi jheronimi doctoris
ecclesiae eximii et zelatoris pmcipui and consists of 123 folia, compared with
the seventeen folia of the Vita Hieronymi of Erasmus; it is an extensive
work. Let me summarize the content: first there is a prologue in three
parts (figure 2). The first part is called “Prologus universalis,” apparently
intended for the general reader, in which Aurelius tn’es to explain the
degree of eloquence and the command of rhetoric needed to do justice to
the reputation and importance of the patriarch Jerome. The second part,
which is called “Divisio prologi pro relligiosis [sic] in refectorio de ordine
dicendorum,” was intended to be read aloud for the special kind of public
Aurelius apparently wanted to address with this work: his fellow regular
canons and the friars of the Modern Devotion. This part of the prologue
gives a general historical background of the life of Jerome and explains
the composition of the biography. The third part, the so-called “prologus
communis,” treats his method of historiography and the sources he used
for this biography, and mentions the places where he found them.⁴

The Vita itself is divided into four books: the first book describes
Jerome's youth in Istria and his education. The second deals with his
travels through Germany and the Middle East. In the third book we can
read about the stay ofJerome as cardinal in Rome and here Aurelius gives
special attention to the role of Jerome as spiritual adviser to a number of
aristocrau'c Roman ladies. After 385Jerome stayed in the Middle East, where
he had founded a convent with two of these ladies in Bethlehem and where
he could dedimte himself solely to literary studies. This last episode is the
subject of the fourth and longest book.⁵ Between the second and third
books of the Vita we find a dedication-epigram of Aurelius in elegiae dis-
tiches (figure 3).⁶ This Epigram is interesting for three essential points which
1 would like to underline: lst, the printer's terminology used by Aurelius for
this manuscript; 2nd, the emphasis of the author on the historical method;
and 3rd, the on‘gin and the sources of the Vita.

All these three points need some comment here, because they help to
clarify the relation between this Vita and that of Erasmus. First the print-
er’s terminology. Aurelius consistently called this work an “editio,'' of
