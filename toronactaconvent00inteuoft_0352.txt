328 HISTORIOGRAPHY AND HUMANISM

literary ability did not seem to agree with either that age or that region,
since then and there—in the most distant part of the barbarian world, as
the Italians say, and at a time when the knowledge of illustrious literature
seemed to be long since neglected even in Italy, that mother of fine
arts—the Dane Saxo nevertheless wrote a work which I regard with admira-
tion. And if Ι could not decide the matter openly by palpable evidence, 1
would not be convinced that something like that could be learned at that
time and in those regions.”⁸

Krantz combined his praise of Saxo's style with a dig at the Italian
humanists. He obviously resented their calling all non-Italians barbarians,
and took pleasure in pointing out that Saxo’s fine Latin style was highly
unusual among his contemporaries, also according to Italian standard.

Although Krantz finished his history of the Scandinavian kingdoms in
1504, the work remained unpublished for almost half a century. But
Krantz‘s activities as a diplomat in the service of the Hanseatic League
brought him in frequent contact with representatives of the Danish
government. His admiration for Saxo's work may therefore have contribut-
ed to the decision to print Saxo.

The editio princeps of Saxo was published in 1514 by the Parisian printer
Jodocus Badius Ascensius, in collaboration with the Danish humanist
Christiern Pedersen.⁹ In this ease Christiern Pedersen seems to have
acted as the agent of the Danish government, the young King Christian II
and his aristocratic councellors. The Paris edition is accompanied by three
introductory letters which are our main source for the understanding of
the events that led to the publication of the book: one from the king‘s
chancellor to the editor Christiern Pedersen, the other two addressed to
the chancellor by the editor and the printer.

Saxo's literary qualities are praised more than once in these letters. The
learned printer Badius apparently considers Saxo's merits the result of a

1546), p. 744: “Haec ad uerbum libuit ex Saxone nostro transferre et inserere, ut per
interualla autoris, quem in his Antiquitatibus secuti sumus, uocem intermisceamus, ut
uideant posteri, quae cura scribendi fuerit iam tum ea tempestate Danici generis homi-
nibus. Non uidebatur tanta literarum instructio neque seculo congruere neque regioni,
quando in ultima (ut uocant Itali) barbarie illis temporibus, quando illustrium
literarum memoria uidebatur etiam in Italia (bonarum artium matre) iamdudum in·
termissa, Saxo tamen Danus in patria sua tum ea scripsit, quae admiramur. Et nisi ma-
nifestis attestationibus rem in propatulo in eis regionibus tale aliquid compertum iri.'‘
