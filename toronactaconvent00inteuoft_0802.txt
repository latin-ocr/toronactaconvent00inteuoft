776 ERASMUS'S PRECATIONES

whereas the next thirteen, the ones we are concerned with now, have
“Precationes e scriptis Erasmi.” So these must have been existing prayers
and this information compels us to look further. As it turns out, we do
not have to look very far: these prayers too are to be found in the Collo-
quia (except for one, which is taken from Erasmus's Liturgia Virginis
Lauretanaew). The same is true of the two prayers whose source is given
as “ex Chrysostomo’'—no doubt they found their way into our volume
through the Colloquia, that is to say through the “Convivium religiosum.'’

The colloquies that served as the source for these prayers are “Pietas
puerilis'' (five prayers)‚⁴¹ “Convivium religiosum'' (four prayers),⁴²
“Convivium profanum'' (two prayers)⁴³ and “Apotheosis Capnionis'’ (one
prayer).‘¹⁴ The passages taken from the Colloquia are not all of them
formal prayers; in some cases they had to be modified and transposed
from the third person to the second person. In “Convivium religiosum,'’
for example, the host, Eusebius, says at one point (I am quoting from
Thompson's translation):

“Now may Christ, who makes all men to rejoice, and without whom
nothing is truly pleasing, deign to attend our feast and rejoice our
hearts by his presence.'' Then Timotheus says: “I hope he will deign
to do so. But since every place is filled, where will he sit?'’ Eusebius:
“May he mingle with all our food and drink, so that everything taste
of him, but most of all may he penetrate our heartsl''⁴⁵

In the Precationes, Erasmus transformed this passage into a prayer by
