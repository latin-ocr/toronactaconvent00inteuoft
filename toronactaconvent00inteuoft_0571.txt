HENK NELLEN AND Enwm RABBIE 547

The poem on Barbarossa is then not mentioned in Grotius’s correspon-
dence until three years later, in November 1639, Willem de Groot asks his
brother whether he wants it to be included in a new edition of his poetry
(a project which was never realised). Willem himself is uncertain about
this, because he expected this poem not to be well received in Rome.²⁴¹
Grotius agreed with his brother, and did not wish the poem to be published
in print, since it would be incompatible with his ideal of the unifioetion of
the churches, which he was propagating more and more openly, eventually
even without reservation in lasge numbers of publications and pamphlets.²⁵

Reconsidering, finally, the reactions to the two “ocoesional poems”
discussed above, it may be concluded that both were influentia! and effec-
tive beyond their immediate scope. As we stated already, Grotius’s person-
al position and reputation played a considerable role: like, for instance,
Daniel Heinsius and Claudius Salmasius, he was regarded as one of the
“aces’' of the scholarly world of his time, and any written statement by his
hand was, therefore, automatically treated as important. Yet, time and
again we see that Grotius’s poems, however insignificant the occasions for
which they were written may have been, constitute an important testimony
and at any rate provide us with instructive information about the poet
himself. Moreover, even in the tiniest epigram, in the shortest treatise the
highly personal tone of the author may be perceived; a case in point of
the saying “le style est l'homme meme.’'

Grotius’s own statements about his poems, unfortunately handed down
to us only sporadically, show that he did not view his poetry as essentially
different from his other wn'tings: he considered the poem on Arminius,
for instance, to be a declaration on a par with his theologica] treatises
concerning the desirability of unity within the church. He regarded it as
a manifesto, and occasionally quoted from it.²⁶ Also his opponents were
of the opinion that his poetry constituted an essential part of his oeuvre.
Thus, in 164327 Andre Rivet reproached him for having changed his
