Let me return briefly to Erasmus’s apology against Alberto Pio of 1531.
In it, he denies showing Mary too little deference, referring to the Paean
and Obsecmtio, “that have been printed so many times.’' The latter is true:
even in 1518, when the Euchiridion was published with a new preface
addressed to Volz, the old material from the Lucubratiunculae was reprint-
ed, although now it comes after the Enchiridion.

The discussion with Pio is interesting because, while Erasmus wishes to
establish his orthodoxy, he also writes critically about the veneration of
Mary. His reservations are so strong that in fact he is criticizing what he
had said about Mary in the Paean and the Obsoemfio, the two prayers he
had adduced earlier in order to prove his orthodoxy! Thus he asserts that
the “Star of the Sea‘’ (Stella maris) is Christ, rather than Mary.²⁸ He also
acknowledges that, in taking a sympathetic view of certain devotional
practices (he does so regularly himself), one may simultaneously and
inadvertently legimitize superstition.²⁹

The two prayers to Mary are not reprinted in the volume that now
requires our attention, the Precationes aliquot novae of 1535, dedicated to
the 14-year-old David Paungartner, son of a prominent citizen of Augs-
burg.³⁰ To start with, its title: “some new prayers, to which are added
new ones, through which the young may learn to speak with God ...’'
(Precationes aliquot novae ac rursus novis adauctae, quibus adolescentes adsues-
cant cum Deo colloqui . . .). It would seem that this title was devised by the
publisher to arouse the interest of the public. After all, considering the
contents, one would sooner have expected the title to read “some prayerS,
to which are added new ones. . . .’' As it is, the volume pretends to be
wholly “new,'’

In fact, the volume had for the most part been published before and
only the first part was new. Besides prayers to the Father, the Son, the
Holy Spirit, and Mary, it contains prayers for various occasions, such as
illness, travel, holy communion, etc. A dedicatory letter, again to David
Paungartner,³¹ introduces the second part, the so-called Eiaculationes,
short prayers composed mainly of texts from the Psalms. These are
followed by a dozen equally short prayers from another source, to which
1 will return shortly. By now, we have arrived at page 75. The nearly one
hundred pages that follow contain familiar material: (a) the prayer toJesus
