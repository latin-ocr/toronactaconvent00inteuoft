disguising himself as a “mooing bull'‘ and swimming across the sea with
a girl on his back. Small wonder that Zoilus castigated Homer and Plato
was forced to ban him from his ideal city. Even allegory, the traditional
way of finding some good in pagan poetry, does not meet the exacting
standards set by our impatient poet s ambassador:

Maneo tamen in sententia, quod tenuem frugem sparsam et magno
et confuso acervo abstrusam ad iacturam potius quam ad lucrum
accedere arbitror, si longae inquisitionis labor consideretur et tem-
poris ratio, quae non parvi ducenda est, habeatur.

Despite the shortcomings of traditional pagan poeti-y, Macarius Mutius has
discovered (to his dismay) that contemporary poets—all of them presumably
Christian-are no more inclined than the ancient pagan wn'ters to deal with
lofty and divine subjects, even though they have the ability to do so:

Ecce florent nostra tempestate ingenia. Vigent studia. Quotusquisque
tamen est qui ad illustrandas sacras litteras stilum accommodet?

Certainly there is good precedent for biblical verse. The Bible itself is
filled with poetry. QuotingJerome, Mutius observes:

Quid Psalterio canorius? Quod in morem nostri Flacci et Graeci
Pindan', nunc iambo currit, nunc Alcaico personat, nunc Sapphico
tumet, nunc semipede ingreditur.

The Book of Job, of course, as everyone in the Renaissance kneW, was
written in hexameters and pentameters. In addition, there were the
examples of the great Christian poets of Late Antiquity who turned the
Bible into verse: Juvencus, Sedulius, Arator, and Prudentius, names
familiar to every fifteenth-and sixteenth-century schoolboy.⁷

Mutius tells his readers that he has determined to remedy the situation
by writing a biblica} poem himself. He is not a professional poet and in
the best tradition of captatio benevolentiae, he begs the reader’s forgiveness
and indulgence. After all he is a very busy man, but he has done what he
could (cf. Mark 14:8):

Quid enim ab homine occupatissimo et qui studia litterarum iam-
pridem posthabuerit, amplius expectant, qui omnia ad trutinam
revocant? Dedi quod potui.
