indication as to the date or geographical origin, thirteen do not indicate
the year, only eleven furnish both place and date. This unfortunate cir-
cumstance will undoubtedly make the chronological classification of the
letters a somewhat difficult task, but not impossible. References to known
historical events or to public figures will in many cases permit letters to be
dated with relative precision.

The earliest dated letter (no. 3) was written from Vienne in Southern
France on August 18, 1509. As the author confesses, he is troubled that an
unnamed friend has experienced difficulties with a brother, and urges him
to make peace. The remaining ten dated letters originate all from Tou-
louse, and range from Sept. 1, 1512 to january 29, 1515. Many of the
undated letters appear to have been wn‘tten approximately during the
same period. Others, however, must be placed during his years as an
ambassador under Francis I (1516-1522) or shortly thereafter as bishop of
Rieux (1523 or later). Most of his correspondence from the later years of
his existence in Rieux and Toulouse, if we can assume that it was con·
tained in the original manuscript, is unfortunately missing in the copy
Graverol had made. Only a few of the letters can be situated, on grounds
of internal evidence, in the early 1530’s. Such letters are nos. 61, 62 and
65 addressed to Erasmus and to Pierre Gylli, where it is a question of
loaning out a Greek manuscript copy ofJosephus’Jewish History belonging
to de Pins' personal library. The same is true of letter no. 64, where de
Pins intercedes in favor of young Etienne Dolet, who had been impn‘son-
ned for violence and “contempt of senate'' in 1534. According to our
bishop’s plaidoyer‚ Dolet is a young man of excellent and rare qualities,
who excels not in one, but in various poetic meters—elegiac, lyric, iambic
and hendecasyllabic, attaining in each the perfectiori of Ovid, Tibullus and
Horace. He further notes that what had begun as mere literary competi-
tion between Dolet and a fellow student of Aquitai ne, had later degenerat-
ed into armed conflict, but argues that in the end no harm had been
done.²⁰ In a period of history where student violence often led to capital

elegiacum tentet, Ovidium aut Tibullum putes; si lyricum, iambicum aut hende-
