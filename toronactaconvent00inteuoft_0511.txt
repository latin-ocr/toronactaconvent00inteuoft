Notker he frequently matches word-lengths in corresponding positions in
each line of a couplet.³⁴

But Erasmus’s innovations are even more remarkable than his return to
the antique form of the sequence. Not content with Notker’s prose
patterning of accents, he wrote each couplet in a different quantitative
meter—a dazzling display of metrical virtuosity.³⁵ This variety enabled
him to vary the length of the couplets, as Notker had done, but it also
meant that the rhythms of the music, which Erasmus would have wished
to follow the long and short syllables of the verse,³⁶ would not be monot-
onously limited by the verse.³⁷

At the same time, Erasmus also seems to be including indirectly a dom·
inant feature of late-medieval hymns and sequences, their accentual meter;
for here, more than in early hymnists like Prudentius or Erasmus himself
in his hymn to St. Ann, the word accents tend to coincide with the quanti-
tatively long syllables.³⁸ He also incorporates a structural principle never
found (so far as Ι can tell) in the Notkerian sequence but very common in
late medieval hymns and sequences: the sense, syntax, and parallelism
show that he has combined pairs of couplets to form seven quatrains (the
last of which is extended by a two-line coda). Each quatrain except the
second consists of a long couplet followed by a shorter one, just as late-
medieval sequences (and classica! strophes too) tend to consist of three
long lines followed by a shorter one. Moreover, the quatrains are arranged

⁸⁵ The scansion is given and the meters are identified in the appended text of the
poem. They were first noted by Prof.Josef Ijsewijn in a review of Professor Halkin’s
edition of the liturgy (Humanistica Lemniensia 31 (1982): 217). I had the pleasure of
noticing them independently and should point out that the thirteenth couplet is in
greater asclepiadeans, not elegiambics; also it seems to me that the verse of the last
couplet should be called anapestic dimeter, not dactylic tetrameter, since dactylic verse
would not allow the anapestic substitution in the first foot, but this verse is so odd that
it is hard to know what to call it.

³⁶ See Opem omnia, ed. LeClerc, 9:943c-E. Glarean made the length of the notes
correspond to the length of the syllables in his setting of the first eight lines of
Reedijk‚ no. 85 (Dodecaclwrdon, pp. 220-21).

⁸⁷ Erasmus's sequence does not fit any of the popular melodies to which sequences
were written; at least 1 could not find one that it fits. But perhaps this is not surpris-
ing, since the quantitative meter would make it very difficult to match the line lengths
and the total number of syllables required by an existing melody.
