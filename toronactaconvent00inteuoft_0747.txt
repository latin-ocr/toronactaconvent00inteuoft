Danish Neo-Latin Epic
as Anti-Swedish Propaganda

KAREN SKOVGAARD-PETERSEN

l n the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a number of Latin historical
epic poems were written in Denmark, dealing with the history of Den-
mark. Some of these are annalistjc in nature, i.e.‚ they recount the history

the reigning Danish king, and can be characterized as versified, panegyri-

a single conflict. In this paper Ι shall deal with three such “classical” epics.

The three poems are united by their common theme, namely a Danish-
Swedish war. During this period Denmark and Sweden were constantly
competing with each other, often with open warfare as the result. This
tense situation was expressed in a great number of polemic literary works
in both countries. Τὴε goal was to denigrate each other, not least in the
eyes of outsiders. Historical writing in Latin was a useful tool in this
literary battle, and historical epic also served the cause of national propa-
ganda.¹ These three epic poems are very much engaged in polemics
against Sweden. In the following 1 shall provide examples illustrating the
way in which authors utilize classical epic models in order to accomplish
their own polemic ends.

The largest of these epics is Margantica (10 bookS, 6666 lines) from
1573, wn’tten by Erasmus Laetus (1526-1582), who was by far the most
prolific Danish Neo-Latin poet. At this point in time the so-called Nordic
