may sometime saye full soth in game,” Stapleton adds the Latin original:
“Ridentem dicere verum quid vetat” (92712).

ln A Dialogue qs Comsort stapleton underlines a grim vignette of a
gamester who plays cards till “the pure panges of death” (116213), which
he also translates as a “wise saying” in chapter 12 of Vita Mori. At 1171Α
he writes “eun-apelia’' in Greek letters, perhaps to correct the “sutrapelia”
of the printed text. Twenty lines further on, he underlines Antony's oft
quoted confession: “myselfe am of nature euen halfe a gigglot and more''
(ll7lC). His interest in similes continues to be attested by the word
“Sim.’‘ at ll7lF. The 1557 glossator also pointed out some of them, such
as “The similitude of the bridge“ (1197G). Here Stapleton adds a vertical
bar, and this is one of the longest stretches he incorporates into his Vita
Mori. More directly biographic is the remark “So did Sir Tho. More
himselfe” at 1201E, where Antony says: “Lette hym also choose hymselfe
some secrete solitary place in his owne house.” This gloss recurs opposite
the profile of the rich man who “hath vnto rychesse no loue'' (1209H). It
is clear to Stapleton that in More's A Dialogue of Comfort the Turks in
Hungary were a screen for the church's enemies in England. where
Antony speaks of this fifth column of apostates‚ Stapleton refers to “The
heretikes . . . in england” (121413).

That the nuo treatises upon the passion (pp. 1270-1404) are untouched
might cause some suprise. Yet one should remember that the first is a
book More never finished or revised, and that the second is Mary Basset’s
translation of a Tower work which was printed in the Louvain edition of
More's Opera (1565).

The letters which fill the last 37 pages of The English kas provide
plenty of grist for Stapleton’s mill. He lists in the margin the virtues they
demonstrate: “Pietas, Charitas, Mediocritas'’ (1447A). Immediately follow·
ing is the gloss “cur causas tacuit.’' At 1454ss Stapleton emends “damno‘’
to “Domino’' (Rom. 1424), and he uses the ssy—leaf at the end of the
volume to index 38 “merry tales’' and “proper comparisons.'’

Two of Stapleton’s central chapters are anthologies from More‘s English
Works: “Apophthegmata, sapienter 8c pie dicta Thomae Mon‘” (chapter 12)
and “Acute 8c facete dicta vel responsa” (chapter 13). Chapter 13, howev-
er, begins with five quotations from More's Epistola adversus Pomeranum,

probably because this unpublished work was not known to the readers of
More’s Opera (1565).⁶
