546 GROTIUS’S FAME AS A POET

epicedium on Arminius discussed above; this is clearly a competently but
rapidly composed product, which deserves attention for its message rather
than for its poetical beauty. The addressee is Frederic Barbarossa, the
famous emperor: his enemies, Venice and Rome, who had defeated him
in coalition‚ are now in conflict with one another over him. The Pope
refused to attribute his victory to the Venetians, and the latter now regret
the services they have rendered him in the past; they fear that they might
well suffer the same fate as Barbarossa. Grotius concludes the ten-line
poem with a taunting remark concerning the secular power of religious
leaders:

Nolite in fastum titulo pietatis abuti:
esse iubet regum libera colla Deus.

According to Grotius, the Pope used piety as a disguise for abuse of
power, but God wishes the necks of kings to be free—a nice allusion to the
representation on the fresco, which, as Grotius apparently assumed,
depicted Pope Alexander with his foot on the neck of Frederic Barbarossa.

The poem is significant not only because of its anti-papal message, but
also because, as in the case of the first example, it evoked considerable
response, which can even now be analysed. Another recipient of the
poem, besides Willem de Groot‚ was the Parisian scholar jacques Dupuy,
who sent it on to Nicolas Fabry de Peiresc. The latter, a famous humanist
and an important link in the contacts among scholars in this period,
confirmed on 24 March 1636 the receipt of “les vers de ΜΓ. Grottius sur
l'inscription contentieuse''; he greatly admired them, and found them to
be completely in accordance with a talent such as Grotius’s.²² In Hol-
land, too, the poem circulated: Grotius gave it to the English ambassador
to Paris, who passed it on to his Dutch colleague, who felt that the verses
were important enough to be sent to Holland. There they finally reached
Andre Rivet, the court minister, who was later to become Grotius’s most
fervent antagonist in theological matters. Rivet even made a French
translation, in order that Stadholder Frederik Hendrik could also read the
poem. Thus, “everyone who was anyone’' in Holland got to see it, and
Willem de Groot wrote to his brother that it met with general acclaim.²³
