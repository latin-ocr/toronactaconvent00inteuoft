794 JEsmT DRAMA

The fact that most of the plays listed may without difficulty be linked
with historical events or persons, should, however, not lead to the assump-
tion that the plays accurately mirrored the historical facts as they are
known to us. In many a commentary on a periocha, Szarota has pointed
out that just the opposite is true, because the Jesuits mainly used sources
written by members of their order from a Catholic point of view, which
often provided a merely partial report of the events.¹³ Moreover, one
should not forget that their plays were primarily written to ensure the
success of the Counter-Reformation‚ to lead apostates back to the Catholic
saith and to reinforce the belief of their disconcerted contemporaries.
Therefore, historical accuracy was of far less importance than the impact
of their plays. Consequently, the Thomas More of their dramas, for
example, is—unlike the historical figure—not a fearful man who retreats
when the conflict with King Henry reaches its climax, but rather an eager
martyr who-regardless of the danger to his own life and without taking
his family into consideration—stands up for his convictions.¹⁴

Most of the characters in the plays are painted in black and white, as is
often already indicated in the title of a drama: Henry VIII is presented as
a “godless tyrant,'’ Mary Stuart as “Royal Innocence'' who is killed by
Elizabeth or “Royal insidiousness'’ and Thomas More is characterized as
a man of “invincible steadfastness.’' Cromwell (Oliver as well as Thomas,
who is the hero of the play Cromwellus Tragoedia of the year 1724) is as
mean a councillor as Mary's brother Murray, who in the end is responsible
for her death. Their positive counterparts are Thomas Becket and John
Fisher, who in vain try to fight against the intrigues of the corrupt court-
iers or the power-hungry young nobles.

The typical stress on the second part of the maxim “delectare et
movere’' is also responsible for a number of fictitious and very emotional
scenes in the plays under discussion. A young nobleman, for example,
awaits his execution, but is taken out of prison on a cloud, after having
fervently prayed to Saint Catherine.¹⁵ The rude soldier Tundalus, who
leads a most sinful life, is moved to begin a virtuous life after he has had

a horrifying vision of hell.¹⁶ Numerous other examples could be added,
but are for brevity's sake not discussed here.
