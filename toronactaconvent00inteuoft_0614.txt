patron. He will then praise his sponsor, and furthermore be joined by

Bartholini’s ode is quite Horatian in contents and style. Meter, structure
and verbal analogies ensure that the reader will recognize the connection.
Horace had found his theme and arrangement in Greek poetry. We might
assume that in reusing Horace Bartholini only followed the latter’s exam-
ple. But Horace had thoroughly romanized the Greek model; the poem
reflected his own experience and aspirations.²⁷ If we understand Bart-
holini’s poem as a description of his literary ideals like Horace’s, Bart-
holini's transfer does not seem entirely successful. Such modernization as
he attempted, still reflects more of the Roman than of his contemporary
world.²⁸ Without knowledge of the Horatian model Bartholini's poem
could not be understood. E.g., Horace’s ode referred to the Olympic and
Isthmian games. This was not merely an allusion to earlier themes of
Greek poetry. Winning these games could still be considered a major
achievement in an athlete’s or poet’s career in Horace's times. When
Bartholini’s ode mentioned these same games, the reference had an
entirely different function. There were no more Isthmian games to be
won. The Horatian formula had become a symbol for the cheaper fame
accorded by “the masseS,’' which the reader could not understand if he
were not familiar with Horace’s ode.

While Horace claims his rank as vates lyricus on the strength of the
subsequent poems, Bartholini proceeded differently: the one poem both
formulated the poet's aspirations and was proof of his mastery in what the
Renaissance considered the highest standard of lyrical poetry.²⁹ The
speaker of Bartholini’s ode is confident of the superior qualities of the
poem; the appeal for recognition which had been vital for Horace is now
an empty formula. The appreciation and distribution of Bartholini’s poetry
does not depend on Holzel‘s judgement any more than on any other
reader’s. The privileged position the patron still enjoys in the poem is not
a reflection of his actual importance‚ but the result of the process of
imitation.
