lary the Renaissance poet had to be careful to avoid any disrespect3 most
of the ancient terms would not have sounded appropriate if applied to a
Renaissance prince.²² Notably the term amicus could no longer refer to
a dependent position, but solely to that of a peer; terms like contubernium
and familiaris or sodalis would have suggested an undue cameraderie. For
example, Bartholini could not have described his position at the Salzburg
court as a contubernium with the Archbishop; significantly enough Bo-
nomus used the term to describe the time when he and Holzel had been
together in Innsbruck‚ holding similar, inferior court appointments at the
beginning of their careers.

Holzel‘s situation was hardly analogous to that of his ancient namesake.
Both men were politically active, but while Maecenas had an independent
social status, Holzel's depended entirely on his career as a “civil servant.”
While Maecenas had a vast private fortune at his disposal, Holzel was a
man of mediocre means and could merely administer the funds of the
emperor. While Maecenas could compete with the Emperor Augustus as
a protector of the arts‚ Holzel played an intermediate and secondary part
in the network of court patronage of his day. We may conclude that as a
sponsor of poets Holzel was and could only be inadequate‚ compared not
only to the archetype, the priscus Maecenas (Ulsenius, f3‘), but also to the
other sponsors at court. This must have been clearly evident to his con-
temporaries, for whom patronage was a vital issue.

On the other hand, the relative weakness of Holzel’s social position
made him especially suited to be styled as “Maecenas” 1 will give two
examples from our collection. The first one is a poem by Heinrich Bebel,
in which he applies to be received amongst Holzel's “friends” (dssf-dSV).
He begins by praising Holzel for prudently favouring the poets and
gaining immortality, like Maecenas and Messalla. Lately‚ however, he has
been slack in granting favours. Nevertheless he wants a poem, but Frustra:
sum mutus l conticuitque lyra (v, 10). The poet proceeds to give the reason
for his reticence: non est qui floci pendat homerum: Ι Ι Croesus habet laudes.-
carmina nulla iuuant (vv. 13-14). With all his fame, a poet has to go
hungry: Carmina sola famem s samam licet addere, praestant (V. 17). Only if
the poet were received dulces. . . inter amicos (v. 19) would he be willing to
praise Holzel in return.
