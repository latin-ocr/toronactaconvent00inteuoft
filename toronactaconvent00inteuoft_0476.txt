452 CATULLAN NEo-LATiN POETRY

Catullus among his favorite authors, and in order to show himself in the
role of a pathetic and unhappy lover, he also uses thoughts and expres-
sions from Catullus's c. 8 and 87. He reproduces in his hendecasyllabics
specifically Catullan words and stylistic features like the diminutives and
the polysyllableS. In a Sapphic ode he incorporates structural elements
from c. 11. These are, according to my knowledge, the earliest attempts to
use the thoughtline of specific Catullan poems and to imitate the Catullan
style. But the instances are rather rare and not very prominent, and
Landino did not continue this use of Catullus in his later poemS. 'Ibese
are reasons why he probably did not have much influence on the later
development of the Catullan style in Neo-Latin poetry. In addition, his
poems were not pn'nted before the eighteenth century.

The successful foundation and propagation of the Catullan style in
Neo-Latin poetry is to be ascribed to Pontano (1429-1503). We may
observe three different phases in this process. He had come to Naples in
1448, where he found Panormita, who became his close friend. Stimulated
by the Hermaphroditus, Pontano wrote in 1449 a poem collection titled
Pramus sive de Lascivia, the second version of which he dedicated to Tito
(Vespasiano) Strozzi at Ferrara in 1451. The problem with this collection
is that neither of its two versions is completely transmitted. But we have
various manuscripts which contain parts of that collection. By comparison
of the order of the poems in the different manuscripts and by an analysis
of their content, I have been able to reconstruct the Pruritus-collectiom at
least to a certain degree. It contained poems which opened and closed the
book, and at least seven erotic, partially very obscene poems, three poems
addressed to friends and one invective on a bad contemporary poet. Ten
poems are in Catullan hendecasyllabics, one is a Sapphic odeÍ¾ glyconics,
distichs, and hexameters occur. The metres and themes indicate that
poetry in Catullan style was intended. The title Pruritus and the first poem
declare as a function of the novus libellus to make the reader prun'ent.
Catullus and Martial occasionally said their versus molles et iocosi should
provoke a prurire on the side of the reader. Pontano surprises the reader
with exposing this aim right at the beginning. His collection stands in the
tradition of the Hermaphroditus. The Carmina Priapea provided some ideas
and expressions in both cases. But in the Pramus, there is also a conscious
imitation of Catullus. If you analyse its hendecasyllabics, you find that
Pontano observed the stylistic peculiarities of Catullus closely and repro-
duced them in concentrated form. This concerns the take-over of typically
Catullan words and expressions as words of value and vituperation,
deminutives, polysyllables, generalizing pronouns, comparatives and
comparisons, particles, intensiflcations, repetitions, and reversals. Then,
