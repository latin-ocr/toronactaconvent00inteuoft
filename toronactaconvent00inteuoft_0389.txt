principis christiani. The final passage underlines Erasmus’s relative uncon-
cern here with the allegorical or religious lesson:

If we wish to be called blessed [like the man in the psalm] let us
ensure that it is not only in our prayers and devotions, but also in

our lives and deeds, that we reflect the only source of bliss, Jesus
Christ. [198Β]

On the other hand, the commentary on the Second Psalm, “Why did the
nations rage?”l Quare fremuerunt gentes appeared seven years later, in the
midst of doctrinal controversies‚ and is thus dominated by the religious
lesson: Erasmus's analysis of what is obviously a prophecy concerning the
Messiah proves (in exhaustive detail) that the psalm foretells the whole
story of the redemption of mankind; it revolves around the characteristic
Erasmian antithesis between the folly of the Cross and the wisdom of the
world. The brief paraphrase on the Third Psalm (1524) embodies a new
point of vieW, as Erasmus himself adopts the persona of the psalmist and
addresses the Lord directly; he makes a parallel exegesis by applying the
story of Absalom's revolt to the persecution both of Christ and of modern
Christians. This is clearly an example of one of the modes of exegesis
proposed in De copia, dealing with “the body of the Church joined and
connected to Chn‘st the head.‘’ Finally, the concio on the Fourth Psalm
(1525), the longest of these pieces, also contains a dual exegesis: first the
psalmist’s words are attributed to Christ on the cross, though in this case
Erasmus emphasizes less the folly of the cross than its redemptive and
consolatory functions, and Christ's promises are applied to the church in
general; secondly Erasmus descends to the individual plane and addresses
a homily (concio) to his contemporaries:

Therefore 1 would request that those of you who have nodded off
should rouse yourselves, and those who are still awake should pay
even closer attention. [361 B]

Interestingly, this sermon is the least eloquent, the most terse in style, of all
these commentaries, almost as if Erasmus were repenting of his earlier
verbosity and constraining his rhetoric to make his style “more conducive,'’
as he put it, “to that reform of morality which is my principa! aim.'’⁶

Itis obvious from this brief summary of the commentaries that Erasmus
treated each psalm somewhat differently, adopting the style and level of

⁶ This quotation is from the exposition of the first psalm (LB 5 174B); in the final
section on Psalm 4, Erasmus is apparently returning to this initial purpose.
