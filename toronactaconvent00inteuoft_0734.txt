708 THE EMBLEMS OF CRANACH AND VAENIUS

highest distinctions—virtue your guide‚ fortune your comrade.’'¹⁶ Vaen—
ius’s Latin verse reads as follows:

Herculis insignis virtus dux praesit Amori;
Hunc ne praecipitem deuius error agat;
thue sui capiat felicia praemia voti.
Laus est, cum virtus dux in Amore praeit.

According to the English translation,

Hercules leadeth loue and loue thereby doth gayn,

Great courage to performe what-so loues dutie
byndes,

For loue by virtues led no difficulties fyndes,

To vndergo for loue attempts of anie paynes.

This conflation of two motifs by Vaenius is an effective way of presenting
the reader with the other half of the Virgilian proposition that “Love
conquers all‚” which we saw dramatized in the previous emblem arguing
that “Love is the Cause of Virtue.’' Now Love, himself, must choose, as
had the young Hercules, between sensual pleasure and spiritual enlighten-
ment, but he needs help. Once instructed by heroic virtue, Cupid then
moves resolutely upward on the Platonic ladder of love, represented here
by the mountain path, instead of downward to a degrading animal pas-
sion. Vaenius surely intends us to recognize at this point the mutuality of
the relationship between Hercules and Love. without passion, Virtue can
accomplish very little. On the other hand, without virtuous guidance, Love
can mistake his goals ands or lack the determination to achieve them.
Rather than making the conventional claim that Hercules is effeminized by
his contact with Love, Vaenius suggests more wisely that Love gains mas-
culine courage and purpose from his association with virtuous Hercules.

The third Hercules-Eros emblem by Vaenius asserts that “Amor Ad-
docet Artes'' or that “Love is the Schoolmaster of artes'' (pp. 82-83). To
illustrate this motto‚ Vaenius depicts an interior scene within which the
roles of teacher and pupil are reversed (fig. 7). Now it is Love who, while
singing a spinning song from a music book, instructs Hercules in the art
of transforming natural fibers into the thread from which the fabric of
civilization is woven. A subdued Hercules sits on a stool and clenches his
distaff tightly between his massive knees. His fingers hold the thread most
