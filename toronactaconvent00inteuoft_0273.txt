Creating Humanist Myths:
Two Poems by Ulrich von Hutten

ECKHARD BERNSTEIN

Ι n his article “A New Look at the Reuchlin Affair,’'¹James H. Overfield
has challenged the traditional view that the Reuchlin affair represented
“a conflict between humanism and scholasticism in which the status, or
even survival‚ of the two intellectual traditions was at stake” (p.l7l). He
argued instead that “humanist support for Reuchlin was less universal
than most writers have assumed” (p.l7l), blaming Ulrich von Hutten‚ and

primarily him, for presenting “the Reuchlin affair as a climactic showdown
between humanism and scholasticism.‘’ “Unfortunately,'’ he concludes,

“his interpretation has been the one which most historians have chosen to
accept’' (p.207). Although Overfield's evidence for the lack of universal

support on the whole is convincing, his remarks on Hutten are disappoint-
ingly brief and need elaboration.

If Overfield is correct, how was Hutten able to shape the perceptions of
the historians to such a remarkable extent? In order to create the image
of the implacable enmity between scholastics and humanists Hutten was
faced with two tasks: first, he had to paint his opponents‚ the adherents of
scholasticism, in the blackest colors possible, establishing a valid “Feind-
bild.” Secondly, however, he had to convince his audience, and perhaps
himself, that there existed indeed a humanist movement and that it was a
strong and unified one. He attacked the first task with all the wit, zeal and
passion of which he was capable in a number of works, including his
lengthy poem Triumphus Reuchlini, the Epistolae obscurorum virorum, a great
number of personal letters and the introduction to his Nemo, and Over-
