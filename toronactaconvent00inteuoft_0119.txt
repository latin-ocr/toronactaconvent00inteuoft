of reading saints' lives aloud at certain meals, both in religious communi-
ties and in households like those of Thomas More.

We need to return to the full resources of rhetoric, which provided
techniques and reader expectations for the delineation of character. In his
individual portraitures in the General Prologue to The Canterbuaey Tales—so
much like the miniature portraits in late medieval art—Chaucer (as Coghill
has made clear) was being his most rhetorical even as he achieved his
memorably individualized portraits that now strike us as so original:

Me thynketh it acordaunt to resoun
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,
And which they weren, and of what degree,
And eek in what array that they were inne
(GP 37-41)

Here Chaucer expresses explicitly the interest in amy and in the degree of
each of the pilgrims, and he follows the Ciceronian prescriptions for
detailing the character of a man or woman by beginning with the parent-
age and proceeding through the attributes. Resoun (a technical term in
rhetoric) announces the sense of rhetorical order or suitable arrangement;
and condicioun calls into question the whole state of the individual being,
both inner and outer. 1 am not arguing that Chaucer was necessarily a
model for the sixteenth-century biographers of More, although surely they
would all have read him. Rather, 1 am indicating that little more than a
century earlier than they wrote, the great Middle English poet found
rhetorical techniques and models more than adequate for his kind of
biographical writing.⁷ To sum up my emphasis on the several traditions
of biographical wn‘ting: in addition to the classical models provided by
such a range as Plutarch's presentation of comparative biography; of the
studies of individuals by Suetonius, Sallust, and others; and of the studies
by Thucydides and Livy of individuals in civic contexts, there were patris-
tic and medieval traditions of biographical writings as well. Nor can we
neglect the nascent Neo-Latin biographical tradition of the fifteenth
century, and 1 remind you of C. W. T. Blackwell's most informative paper
on “Humanism and Politics in English Royal Biogmphy,” in the Acta
Conventus Neo-Latini Sanctandreani, which studies the use of Cicero by

mon Life in Emsmus Gmndescens (1988).
