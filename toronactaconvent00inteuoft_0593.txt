JAN N. PENDERGRASS

Ι n his Panegyric ofSaint lmzis, held at the University of Poitiers around
1509, and published in 1510,l Christopher Longolius makes a passion-
ate appeal to the nationalist sentiment of his compatriots, and to the
intellectual community as a whole, in an effort to ennoble the French
nation both intellectually and morally, rendering its achievements equal,
if not superior to those of the Italian peninsula. It is a period of awaken-
ing national pride, if not chauvinist rapture. After having extolled the
illustrious accomplishments of his Gallie forefathers‚ disdainfully passing over
what he considered to be n'mes of barban‘an decay, Longolius then goes on
to enumerate the major humanist representatives of the new school of
learning in late fifteenth- and early sixteenthcentury France and in other
regions outside of Italy. Among those cited, one finds names such as Guil-
laume Du Bellay, Germain de Brie, Guillaume Bude, Claude de Seyssel,
Badius, Gaguin, Erasmus, [estvm d’ffiaples, Clichtove, Bovelles, Symphon'en
Champier. Also cited among these founding champions of the early six-
teenth-century French humanist movement is Jean de Pins, who, as Longo-
lius maintains, is to be considered a skillful narrator.² In 1510, Jean de Pins
was but at the beginning of a long career, and yet he had already acquired
a pn'vileged and lasting place in the farned “sodalitas'' of new learning.
