Indeed, if emphasis is to be upon applied science, then right use, as even
we moderns are finally coming to realize-witness contemporary stri fe over
nuclear policy and the technology of weapons systems—is of the essence.
Almost as if in direct imitation of Vossius, Milton now turns to the crown-
ing study of prudentia (or philosophia activa), starting with ethics, the
“knowledge of vertue and the hatred of vice,” as he puts it (A ἔθ’ S, V.iv.2;
xviii.l-2; PW, 396-97). Naturally‚ any such study of “personall duty'‘
inevitably depends upon the “morali works” of antiquity, primarily Hellen—
ic, tempered with the “determinat sentence’' of the Psalms and Proverbs
of the Old Testament‚ and the Gospels and “Apostolic scriptures,” pre-
served of course in the Koine of the New.

Then at last, and only then, comes the grand immersion in politics
proper. The first branch of this “science” is “Economics” (Vossius’s
“Domestic politics”—we might say “Estate Management''), a study to be
reinforced, logically enough, by exposure to dramatic literature that treats
of “household matters”: ancient comedy and tragedy in Greek and Latin
(PW‚ 397-983 A ἔν’ S, V.xix.7—ll). It is also a subject important enough to
warrant sending students back once again to Vossius’s lower levels, this
time in order quickly to acquire Italian, for Italian is, after all, the lan-
guage of the main Renaissance culture that has “been most industn'ous
after” such domestic “wisdom’' (PW‚ 369).

'“The next remove,’' as Milton puts it, is clearly equivalent to what
Vossius terms “civil'’ politics (A ὅ* S, V.xix.7). For the English poet, this
branch encompasses knowledge, not only of the “beginning, end, and
reasons of politicall societies'’ but the grounds of law and “legall justice,”
beginning with Judaic law and extending through Greek and Roman to
“the Saxon and common laws of England, and the Statutes.'’ However,
since these are matters of but “humane'’ and therefore limited
“prudence“—the very term, we should note, that Vossius uses to denote
this branch of philosophy—they must be supplemented with “highest
matters”; namely, theology and church history (Vossius’s fifth level), the
need for firsthand perusal of which presumably necessitates Milton‘s
recommending still another return to grammar and the lower ans, on this
occasion in order to gain skills in Semitic tongues of the Bible sufficient
to the purpose (PW‚ 398-400; A ἔθ’ S, V.ii.1-4; xxiil).

Many take note of Milton's postponing the study of eloquence until the
final stage of his “curriculum‚” but in light of Vossius, this is not so very
remarkable. In commencing this branch of study with an emphasis on
reading histon'es, heroic poems, and Greek tragedies of “regal argument”
plus “all the famous politica! orations'’ (PW‚ 216), Milton does not exactly
allow literature and creative writing to crown the study of “liberal’' arts, as
