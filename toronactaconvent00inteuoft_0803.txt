rewn'ting it in the second person and omitting Timotheus's interruption.
The result is a prayer, where we find this rather unconventional line: “May
you mingle with all our food and drink . . .’‘ etcetera.

Another example is the prayer for consensus on dogmatic issues (“pro
consensu dogmatum”) which Erasmus had so much at heart. This prayer
refers to the “gift of tongues‚’' which enabled the apostles to preach the
Gospel to all, while the pseudo-apostles were building their “impious
tower of Babel.” The prayer “pro consensu dogmatum” begins as follows:

O God, thou lover of mankind, who has deigned to confer the gift
of tongues, by which thou didst once from heaven through thy Holy
Spirit instruct the apostles for the preaching of the Gospel, grant
that all men everywhere may preach in every tongue the glory of thy

son Jesus, . . ‚⁴⁶

This prayer is taken from the end of the colloquy Apotheosis Capnionis
(1522), where, however, the “gift of tongues'’ carries the more specifically
humanistic tone of “knowledge of languages'’ rather than “ability to
preach to all.” For instead of the general words “who has deigned to
confer’' the colloquy in question reads: “who through thy chosen servant
John Reuchlin has renewed to the world the gift of tongueS.‘'⁴⁷ This
prayer must have appealed to many a christian humanist. For example, a
copy of the original version (that is: including Reuchlin's name) was found
among the papers of an erstwhile friend of Erasmus’s Gerardus Gelden-
houwer, papers that were published only in our century, under the title of
Collectanea.⁴⁸

The Modus orandi seems to suggest that prayers should preferably be
addressed to the Father, in conformity with the Bible and the Liturgy.⁴⁹
We have seen, however, that Erasmus addressed his prayers not only to
the Father, but also (a majority) to the Son. In this respect, Erasmus is in
line with medieval devotional practice. This leads us to Erasmus's dying
words, which 1 would like to discuss briefly.

We know that the tradition according to which Erasmus on his death-
bed invoked Mary is not reliable. Its most important source, Amerbach,
