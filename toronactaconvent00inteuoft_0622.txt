598 COWLEY’S ANACREONTIQUES

of the anacreontea, but the translations of other poets. Cowley is clearly
aware that the word φρόνημα in the anacreontic, “Beauty,’‘ is probleman'cal.
Estienne renders it as “prudentia” but Andre and Stanley prefer to translate
it as “contage'' (Stanley, p. 83). An earlier English translator, A. W.‚ in A
Poetical Rhapsody (1602-21) had selected the word wisdom, and this is what
Cowley selects, doubling it with wit, to suggest both arms and amor.⁷

Wisdom to Man she did afford
Wisdom for Shield, and Wit for Sword.8

Similarly, in his second anacreontic, “Drinking,” Cowley, like translators
before him, is unhappy with the adjective black (μέλαινα), traditional
though it may be in Homer and Sappho as an epithet for earth. Only
Lubin retains it, both Estienne and Andre substituting the Latin secunda or
ferax (fertile or fruitful) and Stanley concurring with the English fruitful.
But Cowley, no slavish translator, is interested neither in the liberal or the
gloss but in sharpening the wit of the poem. Hence, he reaches back to a
word that George Buchanan had used in his Latin translation, sicca
(thirsty)‚ which Cowley with paraphrastic freedom renders: “The thirsty
Earth soaks up the Rain, l And drinks and gaps for drink again” (1-2).⁹
In the anacreontic “Gold” Cowley is attentive both to word choice and
to the translators' notes as he reshapes the theme of the on'ginal. The
Greek poem is a lament on the difficulty of love, make more difficult by
a lack of money (silver in the original). Translators, following Estienne,
substitute the Latin aurum or gold for silver. Stanley, however, goes on to
say that the real subject of the poem is female avan'ciousness‚ citing in his
notes the complaints by PropertiuS, Theocritus, and Lucan on women who
weigh their lovers’ purses before giving their favors (p. 109). Estienne’s
original title for this poem is “To Love'’; Stanley retitles it “Gold“ and
Cowley apparently follows him. He also appears to be following Stanley in
interpolating a curse on the woman, as well as the man, “who this traffick
first began’' (10). As the word love dominates the first anacreontic, the
four-letter world gold takes over from the four-letter love: “Gold alone does
passion move, s Gold Monopolizes love'’ (7-8). Gold appears as the first
word in seven lines of the poem. In the final line Cowley turns the lament
