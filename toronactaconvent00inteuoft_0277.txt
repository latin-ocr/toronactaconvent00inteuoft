ECKHARD BERNSTEIN 253

for succinctness, Hutten in many of these sketches masterfully captures
with a few strokes the very essence of a writer. A few examples must
suffice. How better can one describe the fiercely independent spirit of
Mutianus Rufus than with the phrase “Ipse sui totus” (line 91)? How
skillfully does Hutten characterize the specific brand of humanism of the
DominicanJakob von Gouda when he says: ‘¹ . . . Qui miscet sacris Musica
sacra suis'’ (line 182)? And is there a more concise way to encapsulate the
essence ofJakob Wimpfeling’s pious moralism and his dedication to the
youth than with the phrase: “Non nisi quod sacrum est, studio complexe
frequentis Qui quidquid scribas, utilitate scatet: l Multa, Jacobe, tibi debet
Germana iuventus'’ (line 209 ff.)? And finally, with what an economy of
words does Hutten synthesize the historic achievements of Johannes
Reuchlin‚ who was also the first German to write a humanist comedy:
“Dum triplice sacros explicat ore libros,s Inter Germanos ad comica
scripta poetas] Primum ausus vetitas explicuisse manus” (line 232 ff.)?

We would, however, misunderstand the poem “Ad poetas Germanos''
as well as the whole cycle of the Qum-elac, were we to interpret it merely as
a colorful album of snapshots of the literary scene at the beginning of the
sixteenth century. Renaissance poetics was a poetics of rhetoric, and
rhetoric is the art of persuasion. A poem, like any other literary artifact‚
had the function of persuading the reader, to spur him on to action or
change his mind. What was the object of Hutten's poem? Was it an
attempt to enlist the aid of the German poets, who would n'se in a show
of solidarity for their beleaguered fellow humanist? Hutten seems to
suggest this much when he says “Quod fecit nobis, faceret quoque Lossius
illis” (line 237). But if the poem was a call to arms, a mobilization of all
humanist forces, isn’t there a grotesque discrepancy between the triviality
of the incident and its literary treatment? And why should Germany’s
humanists come to the aid of this twenty-two year old student whose literary
credentials at this point were very modest indeed. Most critics, even those
favorably disposed to Hutten, therefore either cn‘ticize him for blowing up
this incident out of all proportions or dismiss its treatment as a folly of
youth. Hajo Holbom, for instance, argues that “this affair scarcely speaks
well for Hutten . . . he makes out of this episode a momentous question
involving humanism as a whole and deserving wide publicity,'' adding that
“Hutten's activist nature reveals itself unworthy of the occasion.’'⁵

The judgment is harsh and fails to take into account the biographical-
