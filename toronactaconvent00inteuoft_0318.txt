294 PTOLEMY'S GEOGRAPHIA

sixty-six, and some with none.

Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the Western world would have been
captivated by Ptolemy’s Geography if this had not been translated into
Latin. With some exceptions, the worlds of Greek and Latin scholarship
were unduly separate. Not for over 100 years did Florentine scholarship
set about remedying this. In 1395 Manuel Chrysoloras, sent as envoy from
Constantinople to Venice, contacted classicists in Italy, and returned with
the Tuscan scholarJacopo d'Angelo da Scarperia (Iacobus Angelus). From
1397 to 1399 Chrysoloras, encouraged by the statesman and scholar
Coluccio Salutati‚⁵ was teaching Greek in Florence; and although he had
himself intended to translate the Geography into Latin, he handed over this
task to Angelus. But in 1401 the latter became secretary to the Papal
Curia, so that there was a delay in translating. The translation was com-
pleted in 1406, with dedication to Pope Gregory XII.

In his preface⁶ Angelus contrasts the topographical precision of Ptolemy
with the vague descriptions of such other ancient writers as Pliny the Elder.
Illi enim licet habitabilem universi orbis situm descripserint, mm tamen ex eorum
praeceptis plane captari potest qua arte totius orbis pictura formari valeat, ut
proportio cuiusque partis ad totum universale servetur. In other words, if we read,
for example, Pliny, Natural History III-VI, we shall have no idea whether, say,
India is bigger or smaller than Spain.

Angelus could in fact have made an exception to this lack of defined
latitudes and longitudes in ancient writers. Ptolemy’s predecessor Marinus
of Tyre, whose work survives only in the former’s extracts,⁷ had perhaps
a generation before him listed latitudes and longitudes, but unmethodic-
ally, sometimes recording latitude only, sometimes longitude only. The
lack of precision by predecessors was undoubtedly a point for Angelus to
stress, in contrast to the scientific approach, based on the astronomical
background of the only extant writer to give latitude and longitude
co-ordinates everywhere. The approach aimed at revolutionising world and
regional cartography. Eighty—five years before Angelus' translation, the
Venetian Marin Sanudo the Elder‚⁸ who presented his plea for a new
