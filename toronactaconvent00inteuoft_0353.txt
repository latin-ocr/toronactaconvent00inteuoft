good French education. In this he may be right, although it has never
been possible to prove definitely that Saxo studied in France. We know,
on the other hand, that Saxo's editor, Christiern Pedersen, had been edu-
cated at Paris, as Badius likewise points out. Christiern Pedersen’s studies
in F rance and his collaboration with the pn'nter Badius in several editorial
projects of national interest for Denmark may in fact have been of decisive
importance for the breakthrough of the Danish humanist movement.
The founding of the University of Copenhagen in 1479 was without
doubt a positive development, and some of the first professors seem to
have been of a humanist orientation.¹⁰ Many students still went on to
universities abroad‚ for instance Greisswald, Rostock, Cologne, and
Louvain. But prior to Christiern Pedersen's Paris printings, very few texts
have been retained that actually show traces of humanist influence. The
humanist circle in Paris, of which Badius was an important member,
clearly inssuenced Christiern Pedersen, and the edition of Saxo is the main
monument to his activitjes. His antiquarian interest, his according to con-
temporary standards sound scholarship,¹l the whole context in which the
introductory letters place the edition, all herald a new spirit. The edition
was, to quote Badius, “an omen of a better and more learned century in
Denmark” (non sine melioris doctiorisque in Dania saeculi praesagio).

Badius also stresses the political relevance of Saxo’s patriotic work by
drawing parallels between Saxo’s two patrons King Valdemar and Arch-
bishop Absalon, and Christiern Pedersen’s patrons King Christian and his
chancellor. By calling King Christian a descendant of King Valdemar,
Badius underlines his legitimate right to the Danish throne. Saxo’s own
strong emphasis on the dynastic history of the medieval Danish kings thus
becomes a foil to the present ruler.

The political situation in Scandinavia at the time was precarious. The
personal union between the three Nordic kingdoms under the house of
Oldenburg had to be renewed when Christian ΙΙ succeeded his father in
1513. He was crowned without difficulties in Denmark and Norway, but
Sweden resisted successfully for several years. An advantageous marriage
consolidated Christian's position. The bride was a Habsburg princess, the
future Emperor Charles's sister Elisabeth. The publication of Saxo may
even have been connected with this marriage.
