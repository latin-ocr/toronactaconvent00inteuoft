700 THE EMBLEMS or CRANACH AND VAENms

away from the pleasures of love and sexual dalliance in order to climb the
rocky path of virtue toward ultimate fame, and emblems and paintings
commemorating this decision are usually entitled “Hercules at the Cross-
roads'’ or “The Choice of Hercules.'‘⁵ The moral fable of the young hero
approached by Virtue and Vice was first told by a sophist named Prodicus.
Later related by Xenophon in his Memorabilia (2.1:21-34)‚ it was widely
used throughout the Hellenistic period as an exemplum by fathers deter-
mined to keep their sons heroically at work on their studies and away
from the softening temptations of local courtesans.⁶ During the Renais-
sance, emblematists found the topos useful for the very same reason.

A typical visual example of “Hercules at the Crossroads'' (fig. 2) was
painted by Lukas Cranach the Elder as part of a charming series on the
life and labors of Hercules, a sen'es which is now on display at the Herzog
Anton Ulrich-Museum in Braunschweig, West Germany. Turning away
from naked Vice, or sensual pleasure, a seated Hercules reaches out for
the hand of Virtue. In this painting we find a motto or inscriptio above the
visual scene rather than an explanatory verse epigram. The motto informs
us that, “Sollicitant iuvenem virtus ac blanda voluptas” (Both virtue and
alluring pleasure move youth), suggesting the difficulties for Hercules of
the decision. Cranach's commentary on this statement is the picture itself‚
which clearly indicates Hercules making the correct moral choice between
heroic virtue and alluring sensuality. In 1586, a similar emblem appeared
in Geffrey Whitney's English emblem collection A Choice of Emblemes
under the Latin motto “Bivium virtutis et vitii'' (The crossroads of virtue
and vice). But Whitney‘s pictura shows virtue as the goddess Athena and
vice as Venus with Cupid to emphasize the cosmic importance of the
choice. In the last verse Hercules proclaims,

But heare, Ι yeelde oh vertue to thie will,
And vowe my selfe, all labour to indure,

For to ascende the steepe, and craggie hill,
The toppe whereof‚ whoe so attaines, is sure

For his rewarde, to haue a crowne of fame.
Thus HERCVLES, obey’d this sacred dame.⁷

Not surprisingly, when Hercules does at last give in to Cupid’s arrow,
