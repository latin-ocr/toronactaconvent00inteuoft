694 MARTIAL IN THE RENAISSANCE

complex than those of the others, he characterizes Martial as especially
learned (“doctus”), and more riddling (⁴⁴aenigmatodes”) and obscure (“tene-
brimsuffl) than others. Clearly, he says, such a poet was in need of greater
illumination (⁴⁴maioreface'’). And this Rader provides.

While only a small part of the Scriverius commentary is devoted to the
poetae mens, the work is valuable for its personal glimpse of a circle of
seventeenth-century Martial scholars, Peter Scriverius (1576-1660) was an
independent scholar living in Leyden. His edition, some 950 pages long,
is in three volumes, the first containing interesting prefatory material and
the much-praised text of the poems. The second, Animadversiones in
Martialem, contains notes to the text, mostly emendations, by Scriverius,
begun in 1604 and completed for the 1619 publication date. In these
pages he makes frequent attacks on Ramirez.¹⁸ Elsewhere he laments the
loss of that first generation of Leyden scholars—Lipsius, who died in 1606,
Joseph Scaliger, in 1609, and Casaubon, in 1614-and expresses the hope
that the Jesuit Andreas Schottus and Janus Gruter will take their place.¹⁹

The third volume contains 280 pages of additional notes and emenda-
tions excerpted from the works of eight famous Renaissance scholars,
some from earlier times but others friends and contemporaries of Scri-
verius who each append a personal letter with their contribution‚ bringing
this circle of scholars again to life as they recover and resine the text of
Martial. There are letters fromJustus Lipsius, Pontanus,Janus Gruter, and
janus Rutgers. In his letter to Scriverius, Scaliger urges restraint on the
part of Scriverius in the counter-attack on Ramirez‚ advice which apparent-
ly went unheeded.²⁰ The final three excerpts, from fifteenth- and six-
teenth-century Martial scholars, were selected by Scriverius himself: the
notes ofJean Brodeau (1519-1563), published for the first time therein;
twenty-five pages of notes from Hadrian Turnebus; and selections from
the Miscellanea of Politian.

Among the edition's dedicatory poems are two to Scriverius by Hugo
Grotius, also from Leyden, and another, an epigram of entreaty to Martial
as “vatum optime,'‘ “culte,'' and “pater'’ ofjests and wit, by Johan Panno-
nius, the fifteenth-century Hungarian poet attached to the household of
Guarino.²¹ Another epigram, by Gerardus Vossius, describes a Martial
wasting away with wounds and sores until he is saved by the work of three
