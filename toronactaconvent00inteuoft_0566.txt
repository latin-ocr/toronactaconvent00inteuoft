542 GROTIUS’S FAME AS A POET

views. Arminius was continually accused of heresy, and, though by nature
averse to conflict, had no intention of renouncing his opinions; an escala-
tion was inevitable. When he died on 19 October 1609, numerous co-
religionists were prepared to continue to refine and spread his doctrine
and a serious religious conflict developed in Holland.

In such circumstances, it was impossible to wn'te a funeral ode on
Arminius without taking sides, at least if one did not want to resort to
meaningless generalities. It is doubtful whether Grotius immediately
realised this, for he went to great lengths to try to persuade his friend
Daniel Heinsius to contribute a poem, even though he knew that Heinsius
did not approve of Arminius‘s theological views.⁹ Apparently, Grotius
himself did not feel at all hindered by the circumstances: he composed
four poems, three epigrams and a long σκάζων of 84 lines, in which he
expressed his admiration for Arminius.¹⁰

In this last poem Arminius is portrayed as a man who, while searching
for the truth‚ realised the limitations of human knowledge and thus
recognised the appropriateness of modesty and tolerance. In order to
illustrate this characteristic of Arminius, the poet uses the opposition
between heavenly bliss and terrestrial misery. Whereas in their search for
the truth the living continued to wander around helplessly in the dark, the
dead, among whom now also Arminius, were granted true knowledge. A
most traditional subject matter, of course, but rendered especially effective
by Grotius's master-hand: it brings to light the senselessness of the theo-
logical disputes which had made Arminius’s life so difficult. The poet then
goes on to argue that the truth was not furthered but only hindered by
such theologica} quibbling, his aversion to which he expresses quite
openly. The confusion of tongues resulting from the petty discussions
benefits only the enemies of Christendom. Those who think that they have
a monopoly on the truth and try to force their views on others are off the
right track and only bring misery to the church, as is now clear for all to
see. Rather than wanting to have the last word on salvation and damna·
tion, the true believer ought to stay well clear of such quarrelling, study
the Scriptures and defend the truth‚ even though it might sometimes be
wiser to preserve the peace by remaining silent:
