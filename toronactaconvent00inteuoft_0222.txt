198 THE POLITICS OF IRENICISM

has a clear logie. It seems equally fitting that such an ode should find an
afterlife‚ side-by-side with Castellio, in Oporinus’ irenica! anthology. As the
later attacks on Sadoleto and Flaminio, and on the Lyonnais circle, make
clear, ambiguity could no longer be countenanced in the context of
counter-Reformation.
