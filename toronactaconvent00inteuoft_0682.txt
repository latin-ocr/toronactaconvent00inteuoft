taxonomy, not the sequence of studies, that provides the essential organi-
zation underlying Os Education.

The first of Milton's strands or tracks is the Latin one, of course, since
Latin is fundamental to everything in both systems. With respect to this
strand, let us note a second important difference between the Dutch
scholar and his younger contemporary. That is, Vossius's first, or lowest
level, the “vulgar'' arts, which occurs at the bottom of our diagram, does
not appear in Milton’s scheme for Latin at all. In Vossius’s system, the
various levels of the arts are directly associated with social strata (A ἐν’ S,
I.i.l), and the same assumptions that Vossius adopted regarding liberal
studies and social class patently underlie Of Education too. Inasmuch as
Milton aims at a “compleate and generous’'—that is, a “noble''—education,
his program is for a governing elite, not the gross, unfranchised “vulgar''
(PW, 377-78; cf. A &² S, I.i.l). Obviously, mechanic skills proper to mere
crafts- or bourgeois tradesmen are not relevant to the much more crucial
task of fitting the sons of Puritan gentlemen supporting the revolution to
perform “justly, skilfully, and magnanimously all the offices both private
and publike of peace and war” (PW, 378-79). Hence, OfEducation skips
over this rung of the ladder entirely.

The arts on the second level of Vossius’s scheme, the “popular'' arts,
are another matter, however. They are all arts common to nobility and
patricians as well as plebians, for they are basic to any future acquisition
of philosophical learning and exercise of political power (A &⁹ S, I.i.l). As
one can see on the appended diagram, they consist of such elementary
matters as basic literacy (reading and writing), paintingl drawing (or
drafting?), learning to sing from notation, and physica} training in martial
arts (A &⁹ S, I.ii.1-v. 59). As everyone familiar with OfEducation wssl surely
agree, the first concerns in Milton’s view of studies are exactly of this kind.
Students must begin, he tells us, with the “chief and necessary rules of
some good [Latin] Grammar‚” and since the “speech'' of his Students is
also at the same time “to be fashioned to a distinct and cleer pronuncia-
tion‚’' his line of thought proceeds exactly parallel to Vossius’s in this
respect (PW, 382-83). Note too that, although “boxing” is not precisely
identical with the fencing and “wrestling'' that Milton prescribes elsewhere
in his pamphlet (PW, 403), an underlying concern with the development
of physical skills useful in war is common to both systems (PW, 381,
407-11)

When Milton turns to the next step in his scheme, he in effect enters
the third level in Vossius’s hierarchy‚ just as one might expect. That is, the
Latin strand embraced in Of Education now enters the world of “en-
cyclopedic’' or “polymathic'’ studies. Essentially this phase consists of
