716 GRorms AND LEGAL TRADITION

tion from Polybius, who says that the Locrians “took oath that they would
keep [an] agreement as long as they should stand on that ground and
should bear heads on their shoulders; then they threw away the earth
which they had placed in their shoes, and the heads of garlic which they
had laid on their shoulders, as if in that manner they could free them-
selves from the . . . obligation'' (410).

Ambiguity and apparent contradiction, he tells us (in his second topic),
call for conjectures as to the true meaning. If there is a real contradiction,
then a later agreement between the parties prevails over an earlier agree-
ment. The presumptionis that ordinarily contradictions are apparent only,
so that one should favor an interpretation which reconciles the different
parts with one another (411). These ideas, again, are thoroughly tradition·
al,⁶ but Grotius gives no citations. He does go on to explain the basis of
conjectures as to meaning: they depend, he says, on the subject-matter, or
on the effect, or on the connection. By “subject—matter’' he seems to mean
the special circumstances of an agreement. For instance, “in a division
one-half of the ships ought to be understood of whole shipS, and not as
one-half of each ship cut in two, as the Romans maintained in taking
advantage of Antiochus'' (412). By “the effect'' he means the result of
interpreting an instrument in a particular way. If this result is “contrary to
reason’' then some other interpretation must be found. By “the con-
nection’' he means the context of a word in a particular instrument or the
context of an instrument in others by the same maker.

Passing on to his third main topic, Grotius divides promises into four
types, that is, favorable, odious, mixed, and median. This division, accord-
ing to his marginal note, is from Alciati (413). It is in effect a special case
of the general classical distinction between more beneficial and less
beneficial statutes or instruments‚ a beneficia! instrument being one which
confers greater rights or privileges than the common law already allows.⁷

verborum recedi oportet, quam cum manifestum est aliud sensisse testatorem. Although this
rule is stated with respect to wills, the glossators and commentators extended it, with
ample justification, to cover all sorts of legal instruments. That the significatio of words
“should be understood not according to individual opinions but according to common
use’' is affirmed by Celsus in another text (D 33,10‚7).

⁶ See for example D 1,4,4, to the effect that later imperial enactments are “worth
more‘' than earlier ones. Also D 1,3,24 (“It is uncivil to adjudicate by or respond to
some particular part of a law without taking the whole of it into account'’) and various
texts (e.g., D 22,1,4; 28‚7‚12; 50‚1‚1) where the principle is applied that no provision
in an instrument should be interpreted as superfluous or redundant if some other
sound interpretation is available.

⁷ This understanding of “beneficias’ was apparently first formulated by Accursius
(gloss on D 1,3‚25) by inference from various classica] texts.
