Celestini, and for that goal he received help from Jacques Lefevre dâ€™Etap-
les andJosse Clichtove. He is doing this research because he intended to
write a biography of the patriarch. Erasmus must have known of his plans.
Then after 1500 Erasmus starts his far more ambitious project of the
Opera omnia-edition, whereas Aurelius did write his Vita Hieronymi. When
he has finished, before July 1516, he looks for support from Erasmus to
find an editor. This request is without succesS, not only because Erasmus
intends to publish his own Vita Hieronymi, but also because they have
different views of the most important aspects of Jerome's life: Aurelius
admired Jerome the learned monk and stressed particularly his historical
educafion, while Erasmus rather idealized Jerome the wandering scholar
and philosopher. Nevertheless we can conclude that the bond
jeromessmsmus was not unique, but rather exemplary for Northern
Christian humanism. The life ofJerome had something recognizable for
every humanist, inside or outside the monastery. Jerome too had met with
opposition and he was one of the first Christians to recognize the impor-
tance of Cicero. finally, his plea for the studia humanitatis inside the
monastery was one which appealed immensely to Northern humanists. In
this sense the bond Erasmus-Aurelius-Jerome becomes one of true identi fi-

cation and dependence.
