604 cowlAEv’s ANACREONTIQUES

of this epigrammatica} tradition, though how many of the originals or
imitations he knew we cannot be sure. The final lines of his anacreontic,

“Beauty,'’ apply Pallas’ famous quip on Venus to women in general and
add a coda to the original Greek anacreontic.

Who can, alas, their strength express,

Arm'd, when they themselves undress,
Cap a pe with Nakedness? (22-23)

In a different way the emblem tradition exerts its influence on “The
Swallow.” Alciati in his emblem book has reduced the ten-line anacreontic
on the swallow (Estienne’s no. 12) to two elegiae couplets; he has made
the swallow herself a figure illustrating Gar-rulitas (Talkativeness).

Quid matutinos Progne mihi garrula somnos
Rumpis 8c obstrepero Daulias ore canis?
Dignus Epops Tereus, qui maluit ense putare,

Quam linguam immodicam stirpitus eruere.¹⁸

Why, noisy Procne, do you shatter my morning sleep
And sing your Daulian songs with a clamoring mouth?
The Hoopoe Tereus was justified when he settled matters with his
sword,
And tore out at the root your unrestrained tongue.

Alciati has made the swallow of the anacreontic into an allegorical figure
with an uncontrolled mouth; she is Noisiness herself. He replicates the
garrulitas of his title by repeating the adjective garrula and garnishing it
with the phrases ore obstrepero and linguam immodicam. The barbarity of the
original story of Tereus and Procne is forgotten with Alciati’s exasperated
outcry that Tereus’ action was only a desperate man‘s final defense against
an uncontrollably talkative woman. Cowley might well have known Al·
ciati’s popular emblem. His own swallow is very like the emblematic figure
of Garrulitas:

Foolish Frater, what do‘st thou

So early at my window do
With they tuneless Serenade? (1-3)

He too submerges the barbarity of Tereus with an easy quip: “Tbere his
