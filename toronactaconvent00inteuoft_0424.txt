400 THE ANTI-LUCRETIUS OF MELCHIOR DE POLIGNAC

“one.'’ As to the comparison with number, it is true that any number is
made up of “ones’'; yet an uneven number can be divided mentally into
two equal parts; and in the physical world a line of matter made up of
points unequal in number can be divided actually into two equal parts;
thus “one’' is divisible and the units of matter are sectile.

The basis, then, of Polignac’s arguments against limited division is a
dogmatic assertion of the Cartesian position that whatever has extension
is divisible into parts; and despite his attempt to provide perceptible and
mathematical illustrations it is clearly a position which he feels is in no
real need of argumentation. As a presentation of the Cartesian view it is
adequate enough; as a criticism of the Epicurean position it is less satisfac-
tory. It is true that those of Lucretius' arguments which depend upon the
independent existence of void and matter have in a sense been met by
Polignac's earlier denial of void; but there are others to which Polignac
pays no attention. He does not discuss, for example, the Epicurean
argument from the immutability of species; nor does he examine the view
that limited division is necessary for the re-creation of species within a

fixed space of time; and, as we have remarked, the concept of minimae
partes is completely ignored.

C. The atoms are not etet-nal

1. 873-918: Since atoms are divisible into parts and both atoms and their
parts have shape, there must exist spaces between the parts which make
the atoms dissoluble. Moreover, even if it were the case that the parts
were joined in such a way that there were no spaces in between, it
would be necessary to attribute this to the skill of a designer. In either
case, then, the atom is not eternal.

2. 938-1014: Since the atoms and their parts have shapes which are
appropriate for the creation of gross bodies, we must assume that these
shapes were the gift of a designer.

The atoms, then, are not independent, uncreated‚ and indestructible
units motivated by chance; if they exist at all, it is as the creations of a
pn'or and superior Being who fashioned matter with deliberate design and
who maintains a continuing control over his creation. Thus, in the final
sections of book 3 the reader is reminded that despite Polignac's genuine
interest in the technical aspects of science and philosophy his motivation
is fundamentally a religious one. Early in book 2 he had warned Quintus
what was at stake in the argument:

If what Epicurus says is true, you need not cringe with terror at the
