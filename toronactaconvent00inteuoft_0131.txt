LAUREL CARRINGTON Ι 15

sentences. Erasmus refers specifically to these kinds of statements in his
Parabolae, a work offered for the express purpose of providing wn'ters
with a comprehensive list of such comparisons drawn from ancient
authors:

Cur enim non sic appellem has “ὁμοιὼσεις,” ex opulentissimo sum-
morum authorum mundo selectas?. . . non nitorem modo, sed
universam prope sermonis dignitatem a metaphoris proficisci. Nihil
autem aliud est παραβολῇ, quam Cicero collationem vocat, quam
explicata metaphora.⁴

Although my interest is in both levels of metaphor, it is at the level of the
word that 1 would like to focus primarily.

Quintilian mentions that the Stoic rhetoricians of Greece looked upon
metaphor with some suspicion: “Quid enim, inquiunt, attinet circuitu res
ostendere et translationibus, . . . cum sua cuique sint adsignata nomina?’‘⁵
The Stoics had adopted two premises about language: that words are signs
for things, and that language, like a proper mirror, should reflect the
world in a one-to-one correspondence between words and things. Al-
though such a view might seem extreme in its inflexibility, the first of the
two premises became a commonplace of all rhetoric. Cicero’s Crassus in
De Oratore shows his agreement when in reference to literal names he
writes, “quae propria sunt et certa quasi vocabula rerum, paene una nata
cum rebus ipsis. . . .‘'⁶ Crassus goes on to say that Latin, unlike Greek,
suffers from a deficiency of vocabulary, so that not all things had names
from the very beginning. Metaphor was adopted to remedy this lack:

Nam ut vestis frigoris depellendi causa reperta primo, post adhiberi
coepta est ad ornatum etiam corporis et dignitatem, sic verbi trans—
latio instituta est inopiae causa, frequentata delectationis.⁷

Out of necessity came the added advantage of delight. Part of metaphor's
effectiveness‚ Crassus maintains‚ comes from its ability to call to mind the
resemblances among different things: “illustrat id quod intellegi volumus
