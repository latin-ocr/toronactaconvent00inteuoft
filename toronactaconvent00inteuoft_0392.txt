368 ERASMUs's EARLY PSALM COMMENTARIES

The large number of different readings here should not surprise
anyone. There can be no doubt that what the psalmist wrote, at the
behest of the holy spirit, was simple and unambiguous; but God
allowed these differences, the work of copyists and translators, to
appear in the holy books, so that these extra difficulties would rouse
us from our torpor. [274D]

Thus even in this technical linguistic sphere, the main value of the psalms
lies in their capacity to inspire; the supreme example is St. Augustine,
whose fumbling exposition of Psalm 4, as a novice, may have been utterly
wrong, but led him on to greater things [286F].

Although Erasmus the poet, dramatist, and philologist is kept fully
occupied by the Psalms, it is striking how Erasmus the classical scholar is
almost redundant: his very first comment on Psalm l reminds us that we
are not dealing with the hymns of Orpheus or Homer [l7lA]‚ and later he
says: “I think it more fitting to expound holy writ in terms of holy writ'’
[283C]‚ at a point where the “good things“ in Psalm 4:6 [“Who will show
us these good things?”] would normally lead to a discussion of Aristotle's
categories of good things. Only on Psalm 1, written during his “ethical''
period, does Erasmus draw on pagan philosophers (but in vaguer terms
than in the Institutio, for example) and even in this first commentary he
repeats his strictures on Aristotle as a theologian [183C], partly as a
rebuke to the schoolmen, but especially as a mark of respect for the truest
source of wisdom, scripture. As for the other commentaries: there are
three classical allusions on Psalm 2¹¹ none at all on Psalm 3 and, in a
surprisingly anti-syncretic passage on Psalm 4, the most he will grudgingly
allow is that “perhaps a few pagan philosophers did conceive some vague
notion of God's nature'’ [2468]; he goes on to rebuke apparently pious
pagan poets for not believing what they wrote [249E]. Even when embel-
lishing his style, as always, with his own adages, he is careful here to label
them “profane'' or “Greek‘' proverbs‚ to distinguish them, no doubt, from
the biblical books of Proverbs or Wisdom. Thus, although Erasmus did
not hesitate to apply to these sacred texts the classical critical principles
embodied in De copia, in expounding their meaning he found little use for
Ancient philosophy or literature.

Neither did he enlist the help of the Jewish commentators, as 1 men-
tioned earlier. In fact, a deep vein of contempt for the Jews runs through

¹¹ All syncretic allusions: to the Iliad (213D)‚ to the fablc of King Log (2203) and
to the myth of Phaeton (228F).
