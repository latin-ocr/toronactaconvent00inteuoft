760 ERASMUS AND AURELIUS

ing to compare the viewpoints of both authors, is the neglect of classical
studies in former and even in their own times, and the enlightening
example provided by the education and works of Jerome. The most
important innovation which Jerome brought about, according to both
authors, was the study of classical Latin, of Greek and of Hebrew and the
use he made of this trilingual knowledge for his biblical studies. Erasmus
praised Jerome’s study of Hebrew in the following words:

Proinde cum ipsa re compertum haberet, litteras arcanas nec intelligi
posse nec tractari quemadmodum oportet, nisi cognitis his linguis
quibus primum nobis proditae sunt, sermonis Hebraici difficultatem
improbo studio pervicit, et barbarae peregrinaeque linguae non
solum intelligentiam, sed et peculiarem sonum ac vernaculum
stridorem est assecutus.¹³

Aurelius made a greater effort in his Vita to get the usefulness of the
Greek accepted. On this last point there was as much difference of
opinion, he argued, as in Jerome’s day. He used his exposition on the
importance of Greek to express his disapproval of the neglect of classical
studies in his own environment:

Nam si quis aut Latine pureque loqui nititur aut nostram [Vulgatam]
cum Grecis codicibus longe discrepare affirmat, is continuo hiis
nostris Atheniensibus et sciolis, vel (ut verius loquar) archadibus et
barbaris barbarus quoque videbitur et insanus. . . ‚¹4

In the praise of the Greek language which followed, Aurelius tried to
create the impression that he knew at least the rudiments of this language.
A very profound knowledge it was not, although he was the first Dutch-
man, even before Bude, to use a (wrong) Greek word for encyclopedia,
namely [εν]κικλιπεδιοιν.15 As far as the classical meaning of the expres-
sion ἐνκικλιοσ παιδεια is concerned, it is illuminating to compare the

education of Jerome in the liberal arts, described by both Erasmus and
Aurelius. For Jerome's higher education, his father Eusebius sent the
young son to Rome. His family and friends had great expectations for the
talented young man, and besides, Rome furnished an excellent center of
learning as Erasmus stated:
