194 THE Pommcs OF IRENICISM

loyalties, but most of its members were there precisely because it was still
possible to keep options open and one suspects that for most of them
such a condition of dialectical poise was an essential element of religious
vitality. Yet Wilson was also known in the Italian community, a possible
consequence of his earlier friendship with Antonio Bonvisi in London‚¹²
and there are signs that he was in touch with the spirituali gathered in
Lucca around the figure of Peter Martyr Vermigli. Certainly the dedica-
tions of the two major works which he completed in Lyons, the Commen-
tatio Theologica (1539) and the De Animi Tranquillitate (1543), both printed
by Gryphius, point to links with Vermigli's circle.

Yet analysis of these two works suggests that Wilson held to a basically
Catholic formulation of faith (Purgatory and the Papacy excepted) but
responded to the nuances of reform. The De Animi Tranquillitate in
particular can be seen as an attempt to reconcile orthodoxy, taken in a
residual sense,¹³ with aspects of the reformers' teaching precisely
through a stress on the subjective and persuasive function of language: it
is the subjective impact of an idea rather than its objective validity which
is emphasised. Above all it is the professional theologians, the “recentio-
res’' who are criticized‚ “Siquando illis sacra tractantur, nullae sunt
flammae, nullus impetus orationis, quo incendatur ad rerum amorem
lector.''¹⁴ Wilson's writings in his Lyons phase seek with growing urgency

Non dormitabit, neque dormiet optimus ille
Pastor, Idumaei cura, salusque gregis.
Custodit Dominus tua te protectio, ne unquam
Luce ve sol urat, luna ve nocte sua.
Quantum hic mortalis vives, custodiet omni
Exitum, et egressum dulitate tuum.
(G. Ducherius, Epigrammaton libri duo) Lyons, S. Gryphius,
1538, 50.)

Bourbon congratulates Cromwell on his appointment as vicar-general in the 1538
version of his Nugae (also printed by Gryphius), p. 2863 see also p. 251. For an account
of the group see J. C. Margolin, “Le Cercle Humaniste Lyonnais d'apres l’edition des
Epigrammata (1537) de jean Visagier,” Actes du Collaque sur l'Humanisme Lyonnais au
XVIe siecle (Grenoble, 1974), 151-83.

Tranquillitate (Lyonsz S. Gryphius, 1543), 229.
