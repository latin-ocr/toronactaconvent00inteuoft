dean of Bachelors. Because he was related to Justus Lipsius, Bernartius
was called the latter’s evisam gate‘. Later in his career, he returned to

1601. He wrote commentaries on all three of Statius‘s works and a sepa·
rate set of notes on the Silvae. The dedication of his commentar-ies on the
Achilleia, Thebaid, and notes on the Silvae beass the date of l October

Moretus and was reprinted at least five times from 1595 to 1618. Ber·
nartius’ full-length commentary on the Silvae was first published in 1599
at Antwerp by Flamin-Moretus, again in 1618 at Paris by Tho. Blaise, and
in 1671 at Leiden by Hackius. In addition to his commentaries on Statius,
Bernartius wrote orations and occasional verse, a biography of Mary
Queen of Scots, a trean‘se De utilitate legendae Historiae, a De Lirani oppidi
ab Hollandis occupati, perMechlinianos ἐν’ Antnevpianos admirabili liberatione,
