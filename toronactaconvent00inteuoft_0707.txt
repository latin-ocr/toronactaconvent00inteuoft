civitas; it is rather the translation, or almost transliteration, of civilis
societas. This, Ι think, gives a clue to the origin and ideological significance
of taking “civil society” as a translation of civitas. The tradition of treating
civilis societas as a synonym of civitas gained currency, according to James
Schmidt,¹⁴ because both were chosen by Leonardo Bruni to translate a
famous phrase from the first paragraph of the first book of Aristotle’s
Politics. There Aristode, distinguishing the three different types of “com-
munity,‘' “association” or “society’' κοινωνία, says that “the sovereign and
inclusive community is ἠ καλουμένη πόλις καί ἠ κοινωνία ἠ πολὸτικῆ.
Bruni translated this phrase civitas appellatur et civilis societas, finding it a ·
suitable rendering in the linguistic and historical context of his day
because he had a “sense that Florence was the polis reborn.''¹⁵ The con-
sequence is that the phrase civilis societas, from Bruni’s choice of it in
connection with Aristotle’s polis in a Florentine humanist translation,
carries an inevitable connotation of the classical city, with suggestions of
republicanism, constitutionalism and aristocratic participation in govern-
ment.

There is nothing inevitable‚ there is in fact something paradoxical in
treating civitas and civilis societas as equivalent. The phrase itself civilis
societas is sufficiently flexible. Civilis had the authority of Cicero as a
translation of πολιτικός but both words have a wide range of meanings,
from “civic” or “civil’' to “political’' and to the more specific sense of
“related to the polis.'’¹⁶ And societas has its own variety of meanings.
Like κοινωνία, it is of course a legal word meaning “partnership'’ or
perhaps “association,'’ but classical usage also included “society,” Thus
when civilis societas was translated “civil society,” several choices had
already been made to cut out areas of the possible semantic ranges of
civilis and societas which might not be acceptable. Moreover, when seven-
teenth century writers chose “civil society” as a translation of civitas
(rather than of civilis societas), they were making a very definite commit-
ment‚ in choosing to equate a word which essentially means an indepen-
dent community (civitas) with a phrase (civilis societas) which inevitably

the name of the fourth division of philosophy which the Academics and Peripatetics
add to the Stoics' threefold division into logie, physics and ethioe.
