and Latin, himself and his quotations. Most of his Latin quotations are
additions to the major revision and amplification of the Essais published
in 1588, and he called them “emblems,'' a semi-technical term used for
amplification by additional quoted excerpts as from a commonplace book.
Montaigne finds himself by assaying himself against commonplaces, and
finds his true reader, his critical reader, in him who can recognize both
commonplaces and private places in the Essais.⁹ There is also a much
more general sense in which the commonplace book may be said to have
invented the critical reader. It was by bringing together analogous ex-
cerpts from different poets under common heads thatJ. C. Scaliger, in the
book called Criticus of his Poetice (Lycus, 1561), provided the apparatus for
his detailed critical comparisons, in which we recognise the principles of
what we call literary criticism.

If the influence of commonplace books in their role as vehicles of the
humanist revolution in literature was considerable, their influence on
religious thinking was no less so. We have noted the survival from the
Middle Ages of commonplace books for preachers, but it was only after
they had been reformed that they became a dominant mode of theological
exposition. A method of indexing Sacred Scripture according to common·
places is clearly set out by Erasmus in his Ratio of 1518, with a cross-
reference to the chapter “ratio colligendi exempla'’ in his De Copia which
makes it obvious that the method for making a commonplace book there
described in the context of secular studies differs in no way from the one
he now prescribes for religious purposes.¹⁰ Here too it will be a tool for
analysing texts, furnish the memory, and supply ready material for exposi-
tion and disputation. Even more crucially, it will isolate and juxtapose
difficult passages, and so enable the illumination of Scriptural text by
Scriptural text, which for Erasmus was the true exegetical method. Τὴεο-
logical commonplaces in the sense of axiomatic truths of the faith had had
a place, but a relatively minor one, in medieval systematics. What happens
in the first half of the sixteenth century seems to be that philological
Humanists like Erasmus substitute their favourite method of analysis (by
commonplaces) for the quaestiones and distinctiones they reject, and in so
