120 ERASMUS ΟΝ METAPHOR

carefully distinct. The same is true of Erasmus who, although he indirectly
criticizes the Stoicism of his own creation Folly in works such as De Copia,
yet accepts the divisions and distinctions upon which Folly’s vision is
based: that is, that a perfect language would reflect perfectly the meaning
it communicated. In fact, De Copia itself may be seen as a rule-book for
how to survive well linguistically in a post-lapsarian world.

As a kind of summary, 1 would like to turn briessy to Erasmus's biblical
exegesis, where he holds to the view that God's word can be understood
only through the departure from literal meaning. In thinking thus he stands
well within a tradition established by the ancient Greek theologiam, whom
he greatly admired. The spiritual sense, looking beyond the literal, gives
insight into that which is beyond language to express. Scriptural language
is thus a sign not directly of divine things, but of itself‚ the covering that
must be bypassed in order to view divine things. Erasmus bids Christians
to think in these terms when he writes in the Enchiridion,

Ex interpretibus divinae scripturae eos potissimum dilige, qui a littera
quammaxime recedunt. Cuiusmodi sunt in pn'mis post Paulum Orige-
nes, Ambrosius, Hieronymus, Augustinus. Video enim neotericos
theologos litterae nimium libenter inhaerere et captiosis quibusdam
argutiis magis quam eruendis mysteriis operam dare, quasi vero non
vere dixerit Paulus legem nostram spiritualem esse.²‘¹

Here we have the opposite extreme to Folly's vision of a pure form of
communication that can be accepted at face value. It also represents what
I see as the second turn in Erasmus‘s vision of the evolution of language.
As we have seen, Folly describes the first as a fall from an early state of
moral and linguistic innocence. But corresponding to Folly's description
of the fall is Erasmus's construction in Enchiridion and other pietistic
works of the path to redemption, through a right understanding of scriptural
language. Proper understanding occurs when language that is not purely
transparent miraculously becomes so to the divinely inspired, or to him
whose education in the right use of figurative language enables him to read
it. Thus, if metaphor is one of the marks of fallenness, it is also through an
educated reading of metaphor that man must work out his redemption,
