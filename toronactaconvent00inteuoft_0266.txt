242 THOMAS VINCENT’S PARIA

in order to be reunited with their lover. As the play opens, Lidonia is
lamenting what she considers her son's recent unfilial and debauched
behavior. Nicolaus realizes that Archaicus is suffering from love melan-
choly but dares not tell his mistress.

Phrygio, servant to Archaicus, tells his master that the two sisters are in
Ancona. Archaicus tries to avoid Flavia, while seeking Astraea, who of
course encounters his twin Fulgentius—now a young merchant called
Fulvius, who has come to Ancona to collect substantial debts. Both Ful-
gentius and Astraea are confused and angered by their meeting. Flavia
and Fulvius independently take up lodging in Babila’s inn, where the
braggart soldier Petruccius approaches all visitors for free meals. Petruc-
cius fancies that he will win the hand of wealthy Lidonia. When Lesbia,
the courtesan, asks Babila to arrange an evening assignation with the
Captain‚ Babila and the courtesan’s servant boy Brilla take this as the
opportunity for the elaborate subplot, which involves Nicolaus, Petruccius‚
and Eleazer, aJewish garment dealer, switching costumes.

Tiberius then arrives with his dim-witted servant Asellio to search for
his daughters. Asellio is also searching for his cloak, lost or stolen as he
lest the ship. Much more confusion and near tragedy develop when
Astraea in despair attempts to stab Fulvius who, despite his growing love
for Flavia, thinks the sisters must be prostitutes playing a trick on him.
Spurned by Fulvius, Flavia falls deathly love-sick. Archaicus then feigns
madness to win back Astraea's pity and love.

The identities of Fulvius and Archaicus become clear when all the
players come together at the inn. Astraea and Flavia are reconciled with
their father, and Flavia agrees to accept Fulvius. Marriages ensue—not only
do the two sets of young lovers wed, but also Lidonia and Tiberius effect
a sober union. Moreover, Nicolaus announces that he has successfully
wooed Lesbia. Finally, it is discovered that it was Eleazer who stole the
infant Fulvius. For punishment he is forced to choose between being
hanged or eating pork.

Vincent based Paria closely on Eusebio Luchetti's prose comedy Le Due
Sorelle Rivali (Venice, 1609). Nevertheless, Paria represents a thorough-
going rethinking of Luchetti's action, and the most memorable features of
the characters of each play are frequently lacking in their counterparts.
For example, there are few hints of Brilla’s wit, Tiberius's magnanimity, or
Nicolaus's pedantic charm in Luchetti‘s Brilla, Prasildo, and Nicocrosmo.
The marriage of Vincent’s “worn-out sparrOW‚” Lesbia (Exoleta Passercula
[QIZVD to Nicolaus is new in Paria and caps the pedant's much expanded
role, perhaps elaborated especially for the play’s collegiate audience.
