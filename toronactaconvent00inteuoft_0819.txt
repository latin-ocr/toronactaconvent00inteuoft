of periochae shows that different treatments of the same subject were
common practice in theJesuit order-the degree of individual characteris-
tics of the dramas varying with the abilities of the choragus who prepared
the subject for the performance and wrote the periocha.⁹

leaving the previous considerations aside, the above chronology
underlines the fact that the Jesuits considered English history particularly
congenial to their purpose and, furthermore, that they dealt with far more
subjects than Szarota’s article seems to indicate.

The number and variety of the subjects they adapted for college-
performances becomes even more evident if the chronological order of
the list is replaced by a systemau'cal one.

During a period of roughly one hundred and eighty years, more than
fifty different subjects from English, Scottish, or Irish history were re·
enacted on their stages.

Among the subjects presented are Sanctus Edwardus Angliae Reae The
ngedy os the English Soldier who did not want to consess, the ngedy os the holy
Qrwald, King os England, the Adion os Tundalo, an Irish soldier who abandoned
his sirfid life afler a mimculous vision, Gutbenus adolescens drama, Sanctus
Edmundus puer, Carolus Semndm, Scotia rex, Uyadus and Rnffnus, two British
brathea, noble through thervysslpwple, bedsarnoblerafierthesheddingcfftheir
blood sor Christ, or Sanctus Patritius, to name but a few of those not included
in Szarota’s aru'cle.¹⁰

All in all, the Jesuits dealt with more than a thousand years of British
history, presenting events of heathen England¹l in the same manner to
their audience as incidents which had taken place less than half a century
before, such as the life and death of Charles 1, which in 1696 was present-
ed on aJesuit stage for the first time.¹²

provided microfilms or copies of numerous periochae and allowed me to use their

archives‚ especially to the Provinzialbiblithek Amberg, the Ordensbibliothek Eichstiitt,
the Universitatsbibliothek and the Staatsbibliothek Munich, the Historisches Archiv

der stadt Koln, the Staats- und Stadtbibliothek Augsburg, and the Bibliotheque des
Jesuites, Chantilly. Apart from this, I should like to thank Dr. H. Frings of the
Beethoven Gymnasium, Bonn who allowed me to browse in ‘his’ collection of well-
presewed periochae.
