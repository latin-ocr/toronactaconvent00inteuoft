says, on 29 March 1499 but in July 1501.⁵ 1 suggest that Erasmus com-
posed the For-mula no earlier than the second half of 1501. Jolidon’s
argument in the 1982 Acta that Matthes Maler first pirated the Formula at
Erfurt in 1520 is also questionable. R. A. B. Mynors has argued convinc-
ingly that Adam Petri published a lost first edition at Base} in late 1519 or
early 1520.⁶ Jolidon’s chronology of the three extant 1520 editions,
supplemented by a bibliography of later editions to 1602, remains an
important contribution to the publication history of the treatise. His
mreful analysis of the contents of the work shows in particular Erasmus’
reliance on Quintilian and other authorities.

The definitive composition history of the Opus de conscribendis epistolis
has yet to be written, especially since an important document, although
long known, has not been studied: the citations of Erasmus in Despauter-
ius' Syntaxis. Having recently edited and analyzed these citations, Ι have
been stimulated to continue the task proposed by Jolidon. Here I shall
draw upon two forthcoming articles-“Despauterius’ Syntaxis (1509): The
Earliest Publication of Erasmus’ De conscribendis epistolis and “The Enigma
of Erasmus’ Conficiendarum epistolarum sormula”—to revise the composition
history of the Opus de conscribendis epistolis and to explore its implications
for Erasmus' intellectual development.⁷

The authorized edition of Erasmus’ treatise falls into four sections of
unequal lengths. Neither Erasmus nor his publisher has marked these
divisions‚ which I shall call A, B, C, and D, but the chapters in each
section are closely related in content. ln A, Erasmus defines the letter as
a genre and discusses its variations of style (ASD 1-2:209-27). In B, he
discusses methods of teaching letter-writing (ASD 1—2z227-66). In C, he

does not mention the Epistolimaioi chamklbres attributed to Libanius.John Monfasani,
who has seen a copy of this edition, assui-es me that it contains the editio princeps os
the Typoi epistolikoi of pseudo-Demetrius but not the work attributed to Libanius. Cf.

seminar on epistolography at the 1988 Congrcss of Neo-Latin studies. Both studies are
products of research on Renaissance letter-writing theory and practice funded by the
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Please see my forthcom-
ing articles for documentation of the argument that follows.
