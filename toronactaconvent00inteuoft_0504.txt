480 JOHANNES MURMELLIUS' SCOPARms

sections of a broom, were loosely grouped and interwoven. Murmellius
attacked Alexander and his glossators because instruction based on their
faulty grammar had led to serious corruptions and misunderstandings of
language and texts among other grammarians, dialecticians‚ jun'sts‚
theologians, and clergymen. As a means of overcoming the problems
implicit in scholastic education, the “schoolteacher humanist'’ recom-
mended his own primer, the Pappa, along with many approved humanist
editions, commentaries, dictionaries, and other learning aids. For only by
reading corrected texts of the Greek and Latin classics and the Bible,
along with approved commentaries, Murmellius contended, could the
Christian student achieve proper expression in language and the wisdom
to lead a virtuous and spiritual life.

Compared with other German defenses of the period, the Scoparius was
less original, more crude, and rather labored in its argument.²⁹ These
characteristics may be explained, in part, by its apparently hasty compila-
tion and publication during the tragic final months of Murmellius' life. In
1509 Ortwin Gratius, as a young humanist professor, had struggled to
adapt his arguments supporting humanistic study into the scholastic forms
of a quodlibetical disputation at the University of Cologne.³⁰ In 1518
Busche, still fighting the battle for Reuchlin's cause, constructed his
Vallum, or strong fortress‚ in defense of the studia humanitatis. In the same
year, Vadianus composed his De poetica, a polished treatise advocating the
study of poetry and other humanistic subjects. Murmellius’ Scoparius is
significant precisely because it reflects the more practical, down to earth,
interests and intentioris osone of Germany’s leading humanist teachers on
the eve of the Reformation.
