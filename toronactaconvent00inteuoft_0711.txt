Can we then take Hobbes’s distinction between jus and lex as standard
for the seventeenth century? Alas, no. Suarez and Grotius had both given
much more complex and thorough analyses of the meanings of lex and jus
and of their relations. Jus as subjective right is only one of the three
categories of meaning assigned to jus, and both authors acknowledge it as
perfectly proper to use jus in one of its senses as synonymous with lex.²⁵
We cannot even apply Hobbes’s distinction consistently to a writer so
close to Hobbes as Pufendorf. It is indeed true that on many occasions in
Pufendorfjus is best rendered as “right” (in a subjective sense) and Iex as
“lawss’ for example, the lex naturae is often distinguished as the “law of
nature'’ from jura naturalia (“natural rights”). But in two fundamental
passages which 1 wish to discuss, jus is used almost synonymously with lex.

At De Officio 122 Pufendorf gives a formal definition of lex. Here of all
places one would expect him to make a sharp distinction from jus if he is
going to make such a distinction. But he does not„ The exposition is as
follows: Norma illa vocatur Lex, quae est decretum, quo superior sibi subjectum
obligat, ut ad istius praescriptum actiones suas componat. But what is obligatio?
Pufendorf continues by asking‚ and answers: Vulgo obligatio dicitur
vinculum juris, quo necessitate adstringimur alicujus rei praestandae. It is
impossible to get a subjective sense out ofjuris in vinculum juris, since
Pufendorf paraphrases vinculum juris as quasi fraenum aliquod nostrae
libertati.²⁶Jus here then is “right'’ in the objective sense; like lex it has the
effect not of expressing our liberty (as in Hobbes's subjective definition)
but of restraining it.

The second fundamental passage in which jus occurs in an objective
sense is De Officio 1.3.7-8. Pufendorf is explaining the “fundamental law
of nature” (fundamentalem legem naturalem). Itis “that every man should so
far as he can promote and preserve sociality (socialitas).” Consequently,
Pufendorf continues, “since he who wills the end wills also the means to
that end,‘' omnia quae ad istam socialitatem necessario et in universum faciunt,
jure naturali praecepta. Clearly here the actions which make for sociality are
enjoined by jus naturale, and jus is being used in an objective sense of
“right'' which is equivalent to “law.’' Tooke saw this and translated jure
naturali praecepta as “are commanded by the natural law” and Barbeyrac
has “prescrit par le droit naturel.” It is not then a question of a liberty, in
Hobbes's terminology, but of an “obligation.’'

²⁶ Tooke translates vinculum juris as “a moral Bond'' and the following phrase as
“a kind of a Moral Bridle [is] put upon our Liberty.”
