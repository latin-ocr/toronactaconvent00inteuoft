The Renaissance Commentators on Statius

PAUL M. CLOGAN

ublius Papinius Statius, the Neapolitan poet of the Silver Classical

Latin literature, was one of the more popular and widely copied
classical authors during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The Thebaid,
his major epic on the ancient legends of the house of Oedipus and os the
Seven Against Thebes, was frequently copied, commented on and pre-
served in more than 112 manuscripts.l The Achilleia, his minor epic which
was to relate the entire life of the hero of the Trojan War, was also
frequently copied, annotated and preserved in some ninety-five manu-
scripts.² The Silvae was virtually unknown in the Middle Ages until Poggio
discovered the famous lost codex unicus in 1416 or 1417. The majority of
the manuscripts of the Thebaid and Achilleid contain glosses and frequently
copious notes and often lengthy commentaries. There are at least nine
full-length Latin commentaries on Statius: three written during the Middle
Ages and six during the Renaissance. The commentary of Lactantius
Placidus on the Thebaid was widely known in the Middle Ages and espe-
cially during the early Italian Renaissance as seen in the considerable
number of fifteenth-century Italian manuscripts and incunabula.³ Al-
