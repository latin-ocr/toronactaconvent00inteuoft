Today, as so often before, there is a new crisis in the humanities in
education which centers on the relation between liberal and professional
education and their place in different social, political and economic
structures, especially with reference to scientific‚ technological and com-
mercial studies. It has been argued recently by Peter Scott The Cn‘sis os the
University (1984) that “no single discipline today can aspire to be a suffi-
cient framework in which the most important ideas that arise from human
experience can be incorporated, an overarching context for intellectual
life.'’¹² It is true that the old humanist encyclopedic ideal developed into
the study of the humanities, as Grafton and Jardine have shown, and that
this in turn gave way, with some overlapping, to a study of philosophy,
then history, then English literature, then social studies, and that there is
now something of a gap.¹³ It is time, I believe, for teachers of literature
to return to a broad concept of their discipline, going beyond the still
prevailing nineteenth-century view of good quality imaginative literature in
the three traditional genres, and embracing all writing (even if imaginative
writing remains at the center)—historical‚ philosophical, political and
social. All this is the domain of the teacher of literature. Moreover, it is
time to return to the old idea of the artes sermocinales which cover all
discourse, whether written or oral (and, we might add, transmitted by
whatever means). There is also a need to link eloquence (expression and
communication) with philosophy; this will be achieved in two ways, firstly
by considering criticism, with F. R. Leavis, as “a constructive or creative
process‚”¹4 and insisting on literary creation not just in early schooldays,
but also in the university, and secondly by extending the definition of
literature to include all learning, encouraging cross-fertilization‚ and
reviving the ideal of the encyclopedia. All of this constitutes a new notion
of the role of the teacher of literature. (There is, of course, much debate
about what “teaching literature” means: some, like L. C. Knights, take it
for granted that the term has a meaning which everyone is aware of;
Northrop Frye, and Jean Ricardou, on the other hand, have shown that
you cannot teach literature as you can physics, mathematics or drawing,
