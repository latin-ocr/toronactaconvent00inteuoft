PIETER SCHOONBEEC 635

compare him to those animals. This only makes the bird angrier. It curses
the fox by wishing it several unpleasant fates and then, contrary to the
traditions of the genre, it n'ses uninjured and majestically into the air or,
as Bartholomaeus puts it in epic phraseology, “geminisque alis sese auras
sustulit in liquidas,'’ leaving behind a disappointed fox and a probably
dumbfounded reading-public.

Consideration of these fables as simply two pieces of fifteenth century
Neo-Latin gives the following impression. Reading the fables is great fun.
The Latin is lucid, instantly intelligible and, if not always up to rigidly
classical standards, amusing by its unusual, variegated and at times extrava-
gant modes of expression. Bartholomaeus is fond of variation: for exam-
ple, he uses five different paraphrases to denote an oak, he has some six
words to describe the agreeeable sound of musical instruments or voices,
and several words for the either and the flute. He loves long, composite
words (e.g., dukzfluus, dulcisonus, glandifer, multisonas, anguicomus, semicaper,
and the like), among them some that do not occur in classical Latin and
cannot be found in Du Cange's dictionary. The metre is, broadly spoken,
faultless; the structure of the distichs as to the distribution of dactyls and
spondees over the lines, is comparable to the practice of the classica}
elegiae poets. In matters of caesura and dihaeresis there is nothing excep-
tional in these poems, but they do show a high rate of elision.

Two problems can be discussed with regard to the first fable. First,
although the public was highly conversant with fable-literature either
through the use the schools made of Latin—and even sometimes of Greek
fables or through the translations and versions in the vernacular that had
already been in existence for some time—Bartholomaeus evidently had a
motive for presenting the contents of a very well-known fable in a new
form, which bears the name of another equally well-known fable. The sec-
ond problem arises from the fact that the word sabula or its Greek coun-
terpart had, amongst others, the meaning I already indicated but never
served the purpose of teaching one person a moral lesson or of ridiculing
one person, as is here apparent from the title and the epimythium.

As to the first question: The change of the title appropriate to the
contents (i.e., the change from De corvo et vulpe to De gallo et vulpe) may
have been caused by the end that is envisaged in the title, the “latens
derisio cuiusdam poetae.'' The contemporary in-crowd may have seen the
link between the gallus and the name, nationality or unusual sexual
appetite (cf. appendix l, 42 sqq.) of the intended poet. Regarding the
problem that the word sabula is here not used in its accepted sense, the
solution may be that this poem, though superficially a fable, should be
considered as just another one of Bartholomaeus’s satirical poems.
