important—to leam to judge and convince, keeping in mind the words:
“Omnia probate, quod bonum est tenete’' (1 Thess. 521). An important
complement to the histon'cal erudition of Aurelius was the knowledge he
had gained from the works of Cornelius Tacitus, his Germania, Historiae and
Annales. In the list of historiam which Jerome read and studied‚ we find this
mine first: “Jheronimum . . . legisse Cornelium Tacitum, Quintum Curtium,
Sallustium, Titum ljvium, Trogum, Justinum, Suetonium. . .”²³

Τὴε reading of classical historiography could develop not only pragmat-
ic histon‘cal insight‚ but also a better feeling for literary style. The style of
the historian as well as that of the theologian should be ‘nitidus et cultus‘;
on this point both authors fully agree. They both praise and recommend
in their Vitae Cicero’s style as the best, and they both devote their best
efforts to recommend the Ciceronian ideal as legitimate for any Christian
wn'ter. Aurelius did try to prove the usefulness of Ciceronianism—and in this
Vita he is concentrating especially on De Oratore—with some specific examples
and more generally in the explanation of his own approach to this biogra-
phy. Two passages might show this. By reading Cicero’s passus on history in
De Omtooe (book 11) in which Herodotus and Thucydides are mentioned,
Jerome got the splendid idea to learn Greek, Aurelius argued. The words of
Marcus Antonius in Cicero’s De emtore 11, 9, 36 were in fact the motto and
leitmotiv for him when wn‘ting his own Vita Jherom‘mi:

Nam ut Anthonius in secundo libro De Oratore testatur, qui laudare
quempiam cupit, non solum intelliget exponenda sibiesse genus
propinquos, opes, valitudinem, formam, vires, ingenium, ceterarum-
que rerum bona, quae sunt aut corporis aut extraneae. . .Verumeciam
exponenda erunt in eo quem laudare cupimus quid sapienter et
magnifice, quid liberaliter et pie, quid fortiter et grate, quid iuste et
humaniter, quid denique cum aliqua virtute aut fecerit aut tulerit, aut
eciam quid aliis ad profectum dignitatemque contulerit.²⁴

The Ciceronianism which Erasmus defended with Jerome as his spokes-
man, is rather well known, especially through the work of Prof. Olin on
Erasmus and Saint Jerome.²⁵ Fortunately, according to Erasmus, Jerome
