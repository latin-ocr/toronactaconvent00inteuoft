MINNA SKAFTE JENSEN 43

On the opposite wall of the small chapel is a painting of the Resurrec-
tion (figure 2). It has the form of a three-panelled altar-picce, with the
male and female members of the family kneeling on the left and right
wing respectively. It is inscribed with quotations from the Bible, all con-
cerned with the Resurrection. Following the curved top line of the cenual
painting are the wordS‚ johannis XI: Ego sum mun-ectio et vita. Qui credit in
me, etiam si mortuussuen't, vivet; et omnis qui vivit et credit in me, non morietur
in teter-num. Credis hoc? Above the head of Jargen Rosenkrantz the text is:
Scio enim quod redemptor meus vivit, et in novissimo die de term surrecturus
sum. Et narsum circumdabor pelle mea et in came mea videbo Deum meum.
Quem visurus sum ego ipse, et oculi mei conspecturi sunt, et non alius. Reposita
est hoec spes in sinu meo. Above his wife, Dorthe Lange, there are two quota-
tionszsohannis XI: Utique Domine ego credidi, quod tu ω Christus, filius dei vivi,
qui in hunc mundum venisti, and Marci IX· Credo Domine, succum incredulitati
meoe.

The painting is thought to be the work of an unidentified Netherlandic
artist. Nor is it known who composed the poem.l Stranger, perhaps, is
the fact that nowhere on this monumenta! epitaph does the name of the
deceased occur. The church is full of epitaphs of various members of the
Rosenkrantz family, all duly named. Jorgen Rosenkrantz took over a small
mediaeval parish church in 1560 and started rebuilding and transforming
it into something like a family sepulchre, to which he had the relics of his

and mentions Pieter Pourbus' circle perhaps one of his sons as well as pupils of Frans
Floris as artists to be considered in this connection. She takes 1577-78 as the probable
date of the painting. The poem has not, to my knowledge, been seriously studied
before. C. A. Jensen suggests that Jargen Rosenkrantz himself might be the author
(Rosenholm og Rosmkmntzeme, ed. by Hans Rosenkrantz, Copenhagen: Koppel 1924, p.
148). In my opinion the quality of the double poem makes it unlikely that it should be
the work of an amateur. mse, Ι doubt that composition of poetry would have ap-
pealed to the noble Jorgen Rosenkrantz as a suitable enterprise, cf. Peter Zeeberg’s
contn‘bution to the present volume. 1 think the poem was written already in 1575, but
lack space to argue for this view here. For Jorgen Rosenkrantz' life, see A. Heise:
