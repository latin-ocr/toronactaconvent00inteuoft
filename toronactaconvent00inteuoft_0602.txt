578 JEAN DE P1Ns

script copy of Josephus he had borrowed‚ so that it can be forwarded to
Erasmus. With Alain de Varenes (no. 33), our humanist is willing to
exchange books. The list goes on with a number of other interesting
“personae’' of early sixteenth-century France, ambassadors such as Gio-
vanni Giacobono (no. 69), financial administrators such as jean Grolier
(no. 54), jurisconsultants‚²5 educators,²⁶ theologians²⁷ and their likes.
This first section covers 54 pages in Graverol’s manuscript, and is
followed by a collection of twelve more letters, mostly excerpts, written to
Jean de Pins by humanist friends. All but two of the letters are dated, and
those dates range from 1518 to 1535. Of the two undated letters, one is
a congratulatory epistle from Agostino Grimaldi (no. II.11) and must have
been composed shortly after de Pins’ nomination as ambassador to Rome
in 1520. The second, from Celio Calcagnini (no. II.10)‚ can be dated
perhaps in the latter part of 1519 (or early 1520), as it contains allusions
to the French ambassador's official request of repatriation‚ some time
prior to his delegation to Rome. Calcagnini councils his friend to perse-
vere in his role as a diplomatic emissary, not to return home so quickly:

First of all [advises Calcagnini]‚ so that you do not fruitlessly consid-
er returning home, remember that you must assume first one, then
another mission, of which the first will be extremely brief and hardly
disagreeable, yet the second of which will be quite long and exceed-
ingly difficult‚ imposing burdens on you and great dangerS. . . , yet in
the end I trust you will return home safe and sound, and not without
greatly increasing your personal wealth, for through the favor of a
benevolent patron, you will surely attain pontifical rank, spending
your old days in blissful leisure.²⁸

collection, Gylli had also borrowed‚ in 1532, a Greek manuscript copy of Saint
Theodoretus, on which he based his translation and commentary of Divi Theodoreti
episcopi Cyrenensis explanationes in duodecim prophetas (Lyon, 1533).

Claude de Seyssel (Ysselius).

²⁸ Primo ne quid frustra de reditu in patriam cogiteS‚ scito unam atque alteram tibi
in Italia legationem obeundam esse, ac priorem quidem illam perbrevem neque
multum molestam, alteram verum et longam satis et apprime difficilem, et in qua
labores et ingentia pericula tibi subeunda erunt...‚ sed tandem domum salvus
sospesque redibis nec sine magno rei tuae familiaris compendio, nam viri cuiusdam
optimatis praesidio, favore ac benevolentia pontificalem dignitatem assequeris, in qua
tu posthac foelici otio consenesces (Ms. 215: fol. 169 ν, p. 58). According to the
Venetian ambassador in Paris, de Pins had officially requested his rcplacement as early
