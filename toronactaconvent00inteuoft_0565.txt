“abnormal'' character of the poem on the mortally ill but mentally unaf-
fected Scaliger which elevates it above the great mass of funeral odes on
famous and less famous persons produced in those days by poets and
tasters.

poaeeanother example of Grotius's originality in presentationis the poem on
the death of his younger brother Frans.⁷ From the on'ginal manuscript⁸
it is clear that the poem was not written until after his death; yet, the
reader gets an unmistakable impression that the poet composed it while
sitting at his dying brother's bedside. He prays to God that the seriously
ill man may be invigorated by sleep, and although he pretends to realise
that recovery is no longer possible, he continues to hope until the very
end. The effect of the poem is not unlike that of tragic irony: from the
title the reader knows already that Frans has died of his illness, whereas
this is not mentioned in the poem itself.

We would now like to take a closer look at two of Grotius‘s poems, one
of his last youthful works and one dating from the period of his exile. We
have chosen these two poems because our sources allow us to demon·
strate how they were received and what their effect was. Thus we may gain
some insight into the extent of Grotius's fame as a poet.

The first poem was written by Grotius in 1609 on the occasion of the
death of the Leyden professor of theology Jacobus Arminius. When a
professor at Leyden University died, it was customary for one of the
deceased’s colleagues to deliver a funeral oration after the burial. This
oration was then published, thus enhancing the fame of the deceased, but,
of course, also adding to the renown of the speaker himself. Such publica-
tions usually included a number of epicedia composed by colleagues,
friends and students.

Arminius died at the relatively early age of 49, after a professorship of
six years which had been full of conflicts and which had thus put a severe
strain on his health. Even before being appointed, this moderate theolo-
gian had been sharply criticised for lack of orthodoxy, and his professor-
ship was marked by a series of conflicts with his strictly Calvinistic collega
proximus Franciscus Gomarus, who waged a holy war against his moderate
