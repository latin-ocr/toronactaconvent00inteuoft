LAUREL CARRINGTON l 17

Erasmus elaborates further on what it is about nature that is so attrac-
tive, using here the adjective nativum to contrast with artificium:

thue cum in iis quae constant artificio alios alia capiant, quod
nativum sit, id occulta quadarn vi tangit et allicit omnes, nec paulo
iucundius irrepit et illabitur in animos hominum veluti cognatum.¹⁸

Here Erasmus hints at a relationship between language and man, the
creature who uses it, yet he backs away from pure identification of the two
when he writes veluti cognatum, “as if related,'’ implying, of course, that
they actually are not. This subtlety points to the problem involved in
speaking of language, agreed by all to be a convention, as a product of
nature. Obviously, words like natura and nativum are themselves being
used metaphorically-language that is “natural” membles the simplicity of
nature, which should serve as a model for good speech. Man, a creature
of nature himself, should look inside his own soul to find that model,
which is perhaps what Erasmus has in mind when he writes in another
letter to Bude, “sermo praecipua mentis imago est.'’¹⁹

What, then, is Erasmus’s concept of the role of metaphor in speech that
is natural? We can see that unlike the Stoics, Erasmus does not reject
metaphor, yet his definition in De Copia and critique of Bude rest on a
clear understanding of metaphor as a transgression of a direct word—to-
thing correspondence. Like all writers, he must confront the question of
what level of disruption is tolerable. We can turn to the German philoso-
pher Heidegger, who in an early work explains what he thinks is behind
the drive to keep the “proper'' distance between metaphor and literal
speech, thus keeping metaphor carefully in its place:

The notions of transposition and of metaphor rest on the distinc-
tion, not to say the separation, of the sensory and the non-sensory as
two domains each subsisting for itself. This kind of separation
between the sensory and the non-sensory is a fundamental character-
istic of what is called metaphysics, which confers upon Western
thought its essentia] characteristic& . . . The metaphorica} exists only
within the borders of metaphysics.²⁰

Heidegger asserts here that metaphysics stn'ves to eliminate the concrete
from its language3 thus, what metaphor does is apply concrete terminology
