374 ERASMUS'S SUSPICIONs or ALEANDER

paraenetica answering Erasmus's letter, as the wings of a diptych depicting
him as the cause of all the troubles in the German church. In his letters to
others, time and again Alberto Pio and Jerome Aleander appear as twins
of one and the same anti-Erasmian breeding.¹⁶

Erasmus's first letter to Pio in Rome, dated 10 October 1525, was the
overture of the long lasting polemics with the Italian prince. Pio spent
several months on an answering letter, dated Rome 15 May 1526, many
times as long as the one he had received from Erasmus. When Pio had
this letter printed four years later, in Paris in 1529, the scene was moved
from the Italian to the French capital and the controversy became fully
public. Continued until 1532, it would number five more documents of
increasing size and grimness.¹⁷ Although Aleander was not mentioned by
name in Erasmus's contributions to the controversy, he haunts the back-
ground throughout the polemics. In his Responsio to Pio's printed letter,
Erasmus informed his addressee that in 1520 he had already heard about
the hostility of a Roman “Caesaris orator’' whom he now understood to
be Pio. His informant for this had been the former Papal legate at
Worms, that is Aleander, “your most devoted complice‚'' “alter tibi
iuratissimus sodalis.'' Later on in the work Aleander was pointed to as

¹⁷ The polemics number six documents: A) 10 Oct. 1525: Erasmus’s letter to Pio,
Ep. 1634; B) 15 May 1526: Pio's answering letter, reworked and printed in Paris, 7Jan.

Alb. Pii, answering doc. B; D) 16 April 1530: Pio's answer to doc. C, 9 March 1531, in
Paris published as Alberti Pii Carporum Comitis illustrissimi et viri longe doctissimi, praeter
praefationem et operis conclusionem, tres et viginti libri in locos lucubrationum variarum D.

were two more sequels to the controversy: Antapologia pro Alberto Pio comite Carpensi

vanitatis duodecim articulorum Martini ad veritatis disciplinae christianae censuram sub
