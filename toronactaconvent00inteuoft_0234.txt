210 FACTION VERSUS F1cT10N

proper models for his topic, imposed on Alberti certain limits that, for
some reason, he did not want to transgress.

The matter under discussion in this paper is a curious, but as far as 1
am informed, hitherto unnoticed discrepancy of terminology between the
two versions of the Albertian text. It is the more curious since elsewhere
one text follows the other quite closely, except for a few interpolations of
a typically humanistic or scholarly kind, made in the Latin version.²

The passage in question is to be found at the very beginning of the
treatise, in paragraph two of its first book, using Cecil Grayson's para-
graphing.³ Here the author sets out to define the basic formal elements
of the picture: the point, the line, and the surface. But immediately before
this he gives his definition of the art of painting as such, stating that things
invisible are no concern of the painter. In its literal sense it sounds like a
prompt refutation of the opinion expressed by Alberti's elder colleague,
Cennino Cennini, in his Libro dell ’ arte, written, according to its conclud-
ing note, in 1437.‘¹ In the first chapter of the book Cennini claims that
the painter is able, through his art, to reveal the true thingS, covered
normally under the shadow of the visible word. It must be noticed in this
connexion that Cennini was a representative of the more traditional trend
in Florentine art and art theory, reaching back to Giotto and Dante.⁵
Alberti for his part, then, continues to remind the painter that he should
confine himself to representing solely what can be seen, objects and
phenomena of the visible world, in other words. In paraphrasing the
Italian as well as the Latin text, the word “represent'' seems to be fairly
appropriate. It is, in fact, the one given in the two English translations of
recent date‚John R. Spencer’s from 1956 and Cecil Grayson's from about
20 years later.⁵ Alberti, however, uses two different words in the two
texts, namely, fingere in the Italian version and imitare in the Latin. As both
words were equally known and usable in either of the two languages, he

in the text.
