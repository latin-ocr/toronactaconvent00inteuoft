596 COWLEY’S ANACREONTIQUES

following the Greek text of a manuscript lent him by John Clement, a
protege of Thomas More. Estienne made the manuscript available to his
circle of friends, and Ronsard published the first of his French imitations
shortly before the appearance of Estienne's edition. Some few of the
anacreontea had been known independently before the publication of the
first edition, for they are quoted by Latin authors—Aulus Gellius, for
example—and included among the epigrams of the Greek Anthology, a
printed edition of which, in Planudes' version, had been current since
1494.2 Hence, some poets of the early sixteenth century—More, Alcimi,
Secundus, Macrin, among them—had already turned out Latin epigrams
based on them. After the publication of Estienne's edition, many more
appear, both in Latin and in the vernaculars. Estienne includes Helye
Andre's Latin translation of the anacreontea. together with his own
translation, in his second printed edition in 1556. Remy Belleau publishes
a French translation of the anacreontea in 1556, following Estienne's first
edition. Eilhard Lubin produces a third Latin translation in 1597, printing
versions of the anacreontea that are more literal than either Estienne’s or
Andre’s. The first full English translation of the sequence comes in 1651.
Availing himself of Estienne’s edition and earlier Latin, French, and
English versions of the anacreontea, Thomas Stanley produces an English
sequence which, although it may not actually inspire Cowley’s Anacreon·
tiques, certainly must affect Cowley when he comes to arrange and publish
his own versions in 1656. Both Latin and vernaculas translations continue
throughout the seventeenth century. William King reprints a number of
Cowley's anacreontiques in Songs and Ayres (1668), together with versions
by other poetS. Still more Latin translations of the sequence appear, with
William Baxter in 1691 and Joshua Barnes publishing separate editions.³

Cowley translates only a fifth of the anacreontea that were available to
him, and in ordering those poems he translates he does not follow the
sequence either of Greek or Latin or vernaculas editions. Translators of
the anacreontea commonly follow the order of Estienne’s edition, which
deviates significantly from the order of the manuscript. (Modern editors
more or less restore the manuscript order.)‘¹ Yet certainly Cowley is
affected by his predecessors both in choosing the poems he translates and
