746 CHRISTIAN EPIC THEORY AND PRACTICE

and Mutius’s work was reprinted in Antonio Possevino’s (1593) Tractatio
de pob‘si.¹⁹

Despite his influence in the sixteenth century, literary historians have
not taken Mutius very seriously. Saintsbury observes that little will be
found in De triumpho Christi “but rhetoric.'‘²⁰ Georg Ellinger speaks of
“the meager literary worth'’ of the poem. While it would be difficult to
argue that this work is a literary masterpiece in any sense of the word-the
modesty which Mutius expresses in the prefaces concerning his abilities as
a poet and literary critic is well justified—Mutius's biblical epic may merit
more than passing attention from the student interested in the evolution
of the Neo-Latin biblical epic.

The two most striking features of the De triumpho Christi are Mutius’s
consistent refusal to use pagan mythological characters in dramatic roles
and the strictly classical structure and unity of his poem. Mutius was not
the first biblical poet to reject pagan mythological characters. The fourth-
century Juvencus deserves that distinction. Nor was Mutius the first
biblical poet to begin a poem in medias res. Poems like the fifteenth-cen-
tury Develis Perlament or Parlamentum osFeendis andJerome Valle’thesuida
(1473) use sophisticated narrative devices like flashback or recitals, more
commonly associated with Virgilian than biblical narratives. It is the
combination of these two emphases, however, that marks Mutius’s epic
theory and practice as unusual. He rejects emphatically the dramatic role
of all pagan supernatural beings and at the same time embraces classical
notions of style and unity. It is this juxtaposition of elements in the De
triumpho Christi, Ι would suggest, that helps to make “this little work’' (to
quote Mario Di Cesare) “in ways other than chronological, the final word
in Quattrocento religious epic.''²¹
