own linguistic context. Thus, understanding the Greek of the time of the
New Testament became for him the key to solving problems of biblical
exegesis, along with a painstaking attention to detail in comparing manu-
scripts.

In contrast with these concernS, however, we find Erasmus as a reli-
gious reformer embracing the philosophia Christi, an inner sense of Christ’s
message that depends on personal piety and a pure and humble spirit.
Language is important here in the form of good preaching, for as Eras-
mus writes in his paraphrase on Romans 10:17,

Porro fides concipitur in animo, non per experimenta, sed per
Apostolorum praedicationem, hoc est, non per oculos concipitur,
sed per aureS, per quas in animum obedientem transfunditur Evan-
gelium Christi.²

Yet the success of good preaching depends not on its being a command-
ing verbal performance, nor on the listener's ability to understand in
detail the meaning of each word, but rather on the hearer having an
appropriate frame of mind, represented in this passage by the “obedient
soul.‘’

Thus Erasmus shows in three of his roles three varying levels of con-
cern with language. It is my belief that the question of metaphor as it
appears in Erasmus's work can bring new perspectives to a study of his
different approaches. My plan is first to show how Erasmus's definition of
the term “metaphor‘’ is consistent with the classical tradition, then to
speak more of the position of metaphor within that tradition, and finally
to explore the ways in which Erasmus responds to these aspects of the
tradition in his own writing and commentary.

Let me first of all define “metaphor'’ itself. In its technical sense,
metaphor is a rhetorical figure in which a term is used to designate
something other than its literal meaning. Erasmus in De Copia defines it
this way:

Alia vero varietatis ratio ex Metaphora nascitur, quae Latine Trans-
latio dicitur. Propterea quod vocem a genuina ac propria significati-
one, ad non propriam transfert.³

A broader use of the term refers to the extended metaphor‚ in which a
comparison between two phenomena is drawn out over one or more
