somewhat similar in shape and size. Kaempfer then appends a botanical
description of the Homu or Amygdalus marina to clarify the issue.

Once the whirlpools of the Caspian Sea had been disproved, Kaempfer
posited several solutions to the question of the outflow of water from the
lake. The first theory, which Kaempfer found in ancient authors, proposes
that all of the waters of the world are connected with one another and
form a continuum through subterranean passages. Thus, the waters of the
oceans, lakes, springs, and rivers form a circulatory system and respond to
the pressures of the earth and the atmosphere. Kaempfer’s theory is
clearly articulated in Pliny.

. . . the intention of the Artifices of nature must have been to unite
earth and water in a mutual embrace, earth opening her bosom and
water penetrating her entire frame by means of a network of veins
radiating within and without, above and below, the water bursting
out even at the tops of mountain ridges, to which it is driven and
squeezed out by the weight of the earth, and spurts out like a jet of
water from a pipe, and is so far from being in danger of falling
down that it leaps upward to all the loftiest elevations. This theory
shows clearly why the seas do not increase in bulk with the daily
accession of so many rivers. The consequence is that the earth at
every point of its globe is encircled and engirdled by sea flowing
round it, and this does not need theoretical investigation, but has
already been ascertained by experience.⁸

Pliny’s explanation, which regards the human being as the microcosm and
the natural world as the macrocosm, and which is based on the analogy of
the circulation of the blood through the veins and arteries of the human
body, prevailed through the Middle Ages, and persisted into the Renais-
sance and the seventeenth century. While Kaempfer is prepared to accept
this theory as possible, he recognizes that the reader and others may not
wish to. Kaempfer, of course, could not have known that the Caspian Sea
is ninety-two feet below sea level.

The second solution offered by Kaempfer admits of three options: that
the Caspian Sea returns its waters exactly as the oceans do by either: (a)
the “quasi-mechanical” force of the fluctuations of the Caspian which
dn'ves its waters upwards through openings in the adjacent lands; or (b) by
exhalation when the water is condensed through “magnetic mud” into
little fountains; or (c) by exhalation when the water is condensed by the
coldness of the air into rain. Kaempfer does not provide sufficient detail
