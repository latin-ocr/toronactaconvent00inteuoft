52 LATIN IN 16TH-CENTURY DANISH CULTURE

has as its model the mediaeval Rhymed Chronicle, which was published in
1495 as the first Danish-language book in print and was well known in the
sixteenth century, when it had several reprints. In this poem the Danish
kings step forward one by one and render account of their lives and
deeds. Not a bad model for an ambitious nobleman.

To sum up: even though the two poems convey a common message,
they do so in very different ways. Latin provides more than just the
language; with the phrases go metaphors‚ connotations, and ways of
argumentation that make the Lutheran message look like a natural heir to
ancient philosophy. Such a fusion of ancient and Christian, which is very
typical of Danish Neo-Latin poetry, is often so dominant as to make the
religious disputes against Catholicism disappear. This element, and with it
the general impression of enthusiasm for learning, is reserved for the
Latin version. If the Danish poem had been transmitted alone we should
not have thought of antiquity in this connection, and the text would by no
means have struck us as an example of classical revival. Half a century
later things had changed: the Danish poets of the Baroque age strove to
transplant the ancient models into their mother tongue. Not so here:
Danish poetry is one thing, Latin another.

Both poems are elegant; but the Latin one has a variety of subtle
techniques of rhetoric and rhythm to play on that the Danish one lacks. In
both poems there is a basic tension between the dignified,self-conf1dent
nobleman and his humble Lutheran message. But the Latin form offers
the poet opportunity to let the individua} merits of the deceased shine
forth, whereas his dignity is of a much more general kind in the Danish
version.

The Choice of Language

For whom were the two poems written? As a rule, Latin texts were meant
to reach an international audience; but since these texts did not appear in
print but stayed on their wall in Hornslet‚ international readability cannot
have been of first importance here. They must have been primarily
addressed to the deceased's own family, and 1 would suggest that the Latin
and Danish versions were meant for the male and female members
respectively. By 1575, Latin had almost regained its mediaeval status as the
normal written language in Denmark, but only for men. If women were
taught to read and write, they learned Danish. To what degree Latin had
become the normal choice can be deduced from the fact that there are
occasions where an author explains why he writes Danish, whereas Ι know
