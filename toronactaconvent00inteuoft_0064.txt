50 LATIN IN 16TH-CENTURY DANISH CULTURE

of three of the king's castles‚ Koldinghus, Dronningborg, and Kales. Line
13 mentions that he has had important duties: belonging to the inner
circle of the king, he had been entrusted with diplomatic missions such as
negotiations with possible allies against Sweden during the Nordic Seven
Years’ war, and he had been a member of the peace commission at the
end of that war. He is certain that his native country will not forget his
name—patria is mentioned twice in the Latin poem, but plays no role in
the Danish one. The two versions agree in asserting that God has written
his name in the Book of Life, and in underscoring the orthodox Lutheran
doctrine that this has happened by the pure grace of Christ’s blood. The
literary models of the stanza are biblical; besides Revelations there is the
vanity motif of Ecclesiastes.

This second stanza of the Latin poem is a small masterpiece of ideologi-
cal rhetoric.⁶ On the surface it deals with the vanity of all mortal pursuits
and with salvation by the grace of God. But just below the surface it is
aboutJorgen Rosenkrantz' very personal merits. The introductory phrase,
nunc oblita mihi, is equivalent to the classical orator's declaration of the
items he is not going to mention, leading to a rather detailed catalogue of
what Jorgen Rosenkrantz could pride himself on. And there is a refined
use of the figure climax through the first four of the stanza’s five distichs:
the first step consists of the deceased’s material property, the second of
his deeds in the service of his native country; third comes the fame that he
has earned by them, and finally we hear of the reward that awaits him in
Paradise. On the face of it, this is simply an enumeration ascending step
by step, but in reality it functions as a logical argumentation: Jargen
Rosenkrantz’ riches, power, and meritorious deeds lead naturally to
immortal renown not only on earth but also in heaven. It is not said that
he himself has deserved to have his name written in the Book of Life; on
the contrary, it is explicitly stated that this is solely due to Christ, under-
lined in the elegant verse 20 with its alliteration and assonance and its use
of filius in two senses. But the deceased's meiits resound through all the
assertions that human endeavour is vanity and grace unconditional.

The last Latin stanza is formed as an ancient funeral inscription of the
siste viator type; the pattern of the genre explains the slightly awkward
quicumque: Jorgen Rosenkrantz could expect his descendants to take over,
but the ancient model required an unspecified addressee, the incidental
passer-by. The stanza is a compact example of imitatio of ancient pagan

⁶ By “ideology” 1 mean: a world-view, appealing to emotions rather than logie, and
often expressed implicitly under a different surface message.
