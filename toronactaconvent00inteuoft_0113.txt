poverty—connected because they are all manifestations of injustice on
either a personal or societal level, lead to the same general result, albeit
with differences in degree that let us make a fine discrimination between
poverty and other causes: the poverty·stn'cken serui wear no chains. Being
a semus in Utopia may ameliorate injustice, then, benefitting both the
seruus and the social order as a whole. But it hardly solves all the problems
the text raises (the serui-war link is particularly problematic), nor does it
bring about complete justice. Indeed it generates injustices of its own, or
would do if Utopia were not a fantasy world.

In this connection we can remember More's second letter to Peter Giles
(appearing only in the 1517 edition), in which he answered the objections
of some “sharp-sighted” reader who had detected “some little absurdides'’
in the institutions of Utopia: “What should he be so minded as if there
were nothing absurd elsewhere in the world or as if any of all the philoso-
phers had ever ordered the commonwealth, the ruler, or even the private
home without instituting some feature that had better be changed‘'
(249s 28, 29, 31-34)? Thus we are encouraged to reopen questions that
Hythlodaeus often presents as if they were solutions, despite his disclaim-
ers. We do so, though, with a fuller sense of the social, ethical, and politica!
issues involved, a sharper sense of how unjust extant institutions and customs
may be, and a deeper sense of how complex the question of community is.

As so frequently happens in the Utopia, “De Servis” articulates these
concerns inductively and deviously; we need to play with each of the
customs imagined and described in such extraordinary detail, detecting
the incongruities in Hythlodaeus’s densely realized discourse and juxtapos-
ing one with another in Utopia and elsewhere. Marn'age, for instance, is the
most fully developed segment in “De Servis.‘’ Its extended treatment of
bonds entered into and kept or broken (at once intensely comic and intense-
ly serious and worthy of the lawyer its author is) invites compar-ison with the
long segment on treaties, which are always broken in that part of the
world—though never in Europe, according to Hythlodaeus-as well as with
European marriage practices. And it also reopens questions about what keep-
ing one's word means, bringing us face to face with the idea of community.

Behind all these customs, moreover, is the still larger question of equity
and justice. “Aequitas’'—“Equitee: iustice: euennesse: likenes of facion,“
according to Cooper's Thesaurus—is part of the first marginal comment in

go: The Univ. of Chicago Press, 1980), 47-58, tellingly explores the place of shame in
the communal ethos that constitutes Utopia and its social and psychological signifi-
cance sor More himself.
