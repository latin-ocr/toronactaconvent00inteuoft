The Reconstruction of a Genre:
Carolus Sigonius and the Theorization

of Renaissance Dialogue

DONALD GILMAN

Ι n his Discono dell’arte del dialogo (1586), Torquato Tasso defines the
dialogue simply and succinctly as the imitation of discussion.¹ A type
of discussion is, of course, argumentation, and the dialectical dialogue,
which is one form of this literary kind, becomes accordingly an imitation
of disputation. Dialogue, then, is not a treatise postulating and elaborating
one single statement. Rather, the presentation of varying opinions re-
quires the use of interlocutors who reveal individual characteristics,
attitudes‚ and personalities. Combining the roles of poet and logician, the
writer of dialogue reproduces in prose the traits and thoughts of fictitious
personages and, at the same time, records the subtle and sophisticated
forms of their reasoning. For Tasso, the dialectical dialogue includes the
topics, but transcends the generic limits, of philosophy. It is, in short, an
artistic representation of argumentation which is a mimesis, or imaginative
imitation, of man's search for truth.

Tasso's theorization of dialogue was not totally original. In fact, his
Discorso can be described, in many ways, as a vernaculas summary of a
Latin treatise‚ De dialogo liber (Venice, 1561), by his teacher at Padua,
Carolus Sigonius (ca. 1524-1584).² As professor of Greek at Venice
