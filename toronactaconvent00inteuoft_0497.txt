JAMEs v. MEHL 473

Timann Kemner, Murmellius by 1509 had become rector of St. Ludger’s
School in Mfinster‚ where he introduced the study of Greek.¹⁰ In 1512
Langen persuaded him to return as co—rector of the cathedra! school,
where he continued the efforts ofJohannes Caesarius in Greek instruc-
tion. But within a year Murmellius accepted appointment as rector of the
Latin school in Alkmaar. During the summer of 1517 that unfortunate city
was sacked by troops involved in the Gelderland wars, forcing Murmellius,
his wife, and young son to flee to Zwolle, Again, a dispute with the
headmaster there, Gerhard ustrius, prompted him to take a position in
Deventer. After only about a month in Deventer‚ Murmellius died unex-
pectedly (October 2, 1517) at the age of thirty-seven.¹¹ There were wide-
spread rumors at the time that Murmellius had been given poisoned wine
by Lisfflus, prompted by the controversy in Zwolle, but the more likely
cause of death was an attack of pneumonia or the plague.¹² It was during
these last years of persona] difficulty and tragedy that Murmellius was
preparing his Scoparius for the press.

The δωρον-ἰω- was not only Murmellius’ last major work, but represent-
ed the culmination of his efforts as a humanist reformer. Nauwelaerts has
described it as “zijn humanistische geloofsbelijdenis,” his humanistic
creed.¹³ Murmellius’ prefatory letters to two former colleagues at Zwolle,
Hermann Stiive and Alexander von Meppen, indicate that the manuscript
was already in preparation in that city and that it was carried along on the
hasty trip to Alkmaar.¹⁴ Reichling suggests that the first edition was
printed during the months of August or September by the Deventer
pn’nter Albert Paffraet, since Murmellius had only just arrived in the city
at that point.¹⁵ But interna] evidence from the document itself shows
that the collection of literary selections had been long in preparation. The
selections, many of which have been carefully traced and documented in
