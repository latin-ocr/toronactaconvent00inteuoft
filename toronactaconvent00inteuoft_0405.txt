assure Erasmus that Pio’s first sign of life after the Sacco di Roma had
reached him was the posthumously published final attack in Tuaenty-three
Book-5 on Erasmus. Only thanks to the insertion of the preceding docu-
ments of the controversy in Pio‘s last work did he now know about the
polemics. Then Aleander immediately goes on to deny the authorship of
Soeliger's Omtio. To prove his sincerity,⁶³ he informs Erasmus that he,
Erasmus, owed his cherished, eight-year old letter from Pope Adrian to
his, Aleander’s, pen.

It is a proven fact that Aleander is right in the last two cases, that is,
Scaliger’s Oratio and Pope Adrian’s Breve. This makes it wise to start with
the assumption that he also was sincere in his first assertion, the denial of
having had any part in Pio’s Twenty-three Books. And there are some
indications which support this assumption. After the arrival of Erasmus’s
letter, on 28 January 1532, Aleander, once again pontifical legate on his
way to the German Diet of Regensburg, wrote from Cologne to Giovan
Battista Sanga about the alleged authorship of Scaliger’s Oratio. In it he
ironically observed how productive an author he must be and how much
leisure he must have, to be able to compose books for others, such as the
Pn'nce of Carpi, and whoever the other, called Scaliger, may be.⁶⁴ Actual-
ly, there was no reason for Aleander to deny to Sanga, a possible contribu-
tion to Pio’s work which enjoyed approval among the Italian churchmen.
I may add that, twelve years before, Erasmus had rebuked with a similar
argumentation Aleander’s assumption of his being the author of numer-
ous Lutheran pamphlets at the Diet of Worms.‘³⁵

A second indication of Aleander’s sincen‘ty is found in the report of the
meeting Erasmus's correspondent Jacob Spiegel had with him in Speyer.
Here too, Aleander casually and unemotionally blamed the spokesman
who had erroneously convinced Erasmus of his part in Pio’s work. Spiegel,
at least, obviously found no reason to distrust the statement.⁶⁶

Fmally, I must remind you that Erasmus’s suspicions were partly
occasioned by the simultaneous arrival in Basel of Pio’s Epistola paraenetica

⁶⁸ Ep. 2638, l. 33. For Adrian’s Breve and Aleander's share in it, cf. Ep. 1324 and
Allen's Introduction.

⁶⁴ Cf. H. Laemmer, Monumenta Vaticana historiam ecclesiasticam saeculi XVI illus-
trantia (Freiburg i.Br., 1861), p. 99.

⁶⁵ Cf. Ep. 1218, 1.17: “0 me fecundum, qui tot libellis scribendis sufficiam.‘'

⁶⁶ Cf. Ep. 2572, ll. 7-16. It is not clear whether the crushing statement, “Fuit
Carpensis irrequieto animo, ingenio vafro et perfido‚” renders the purport of Spiegel’s
conversation with Aleander, or merely Spiegel’s own opinion.
