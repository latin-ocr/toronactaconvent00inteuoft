stern realities of lowland floods, passing to the significance of the new
academy for seafaring Netherlanders cruising to far-off transoceanic
shores. Then abruptly in the middle there comes a two line interruption,
a digression, a painful parenthetica} aside and a private sigh:

At quae (forte rogas) agitant tua pectora curae?
[But‚ perhaps you ask, what grief aches there in
your breast?]

Non haec Virgineis pervia Sacra choris.

[No girls will gather in these hallowed halls.]⁵

So much she allowed herself, and then she returned to the accepted
theme in hand.

In the Netherlands, the classic land of controversy between predestinar-
ian Calvinists and free-will Arminians, during that decade a practical issue
was agitated among theologians and physicians: De Termino Vitae, on the
bounds of human life: was the life span of each person predetermined by
divine providence, not to be tampered with by mortals and their means,
or was it in some measure indeterminate, so that physicians might proper-
ly intervene to prolong an invalid's life? About 1632 Jan van Beverwyck
(Latin, Beverovicius)‚ professor of medicine and burgomaster of Dord-
recht, initiated a wide epistolary discussion of these issues, and presently
he collected and published the responses he had received. This led to a
series of successively larger collections, printed 1634, 1636, 1639, and
1651, with many contributors, including Hugo Grotius, Simon Episcopius,
Gerard Vossius, and Gabriel Naude. Most striking, in the 1639 printing,
the response by Anna Maria van Schurman received special notice on the
initial title page and her essay was accorded special placement in a pars
tertia with its own additional title page: a segregation that seems to have
been intended as an honor.⁶ (It should be noticed that a much longer

⁶ All of these have very long titles. The 1639 text will suffice here. Appended to the
1636 edition, it reads Joh. Beverovicii Epistolica Quoestio, De Vicae Termino, Fatali an Mobili?

1651. It had been turned into Dutch, again featuring Anna Maria van Schurmann, in
Pael-Steen van den Tyt Onsoe Levens, Dordrecht, 1639. Other exchanges between Beverovic-
ius and Anna Maria van Schurmann are printed in a different work, Epistolicae Quoestiones·
