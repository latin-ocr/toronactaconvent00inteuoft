divisible. It is a simple statement of the Cartesian position rather than
an argument.⁹ What is surprising‚ however, is that Polignac does not
direct his attention at all to the question of minimae partes, a concept
adopted by the atomists in a deliberate attempt to resolve this very
difficulty; a concept which Lucretius himself took great pains to explain
and which Gassendi also adopted.¹⁰

2. 5 7 7-677: The principle of infinite division is capable of being proven by

examples both perceptible and geometrical. Among the former Polig-
nac points to the extremely diffusible nature of hammered bronze,
smoke, dye, and sulphur. Chief among the geometn'cal illustrations is
the case of concentric circles, where the innermost circle can be divided
into as many parts as the outermost.

. 702-43: Polignac refutes Lucretius' argument (1. 615-27) that infinite
division would mean the equality of the smallest and the largest objects
by arguing that while two bodies may be infinitely divisible, it is a case
of division not into equal but into decreasing parts, and so the sum of
the parts will not be the same. He then offers an ingenious application
of Lucretius' mistaken belief in the equality of infinities to the Epicure-
an doctrine of an infinite number of atoms of each shape: if infinities
are equal‚ then, according to the atomists, there will be as many atoms
o'f one shape as there are of all shapes; also, the total number of atoms
of one shape will have to include the total number of atoms of all
shapes.

. 744-802: A treatment of the Epicurean argument that what exists must
be simple; therefore, there must exist bodies that are indivisible; in-
deed, if there were no such bodies there would be no beginnings of
matter; for just as the beginning of number is “one‚” so the beginning

of a compound body is “one‚'' and bodies are made up of several
“ones‚'’

Polignac replies by agreeing that whatever exists is “one''; but what is

meant by “one’' here is not the same as when we say that something is
“one'' because it lacks parts; in this latter sense only God and the human
mind are “one‘' and incapable of division; matter can no more be “one’'
than Mind can be divided; only that which does not have extension can be
