apart from this we should note that it was not intended as a translation
but as a very free paraphrase. Perhaps Italian was regarded as largely the
lang-uage of the arts, while Latin was also that of sciences. But in addition
the mapmakers were wondering how much world cartography could or
should, after over 1300 years, be updated. Clearly Berlinghieri could
incorporate by this method a more current world map. His own was
evidently recognised as such by the anonymous compiler of the Wilczek-
Brown codex of Ptolemy maps‚ now at the John Carter Brown Library,
Providence, R.I.¹⁶ In that codex, instead of a manuscript world map to
go with the manuscript regional maps‚ we find Berlinghieri’s pn‘nted
world map of 1482.

The other edition of the same year is that of Ulm,¹⁷ with preface by
Donis (=Donnus) Nicolaus Germanus dedicating the work to Pope Paul 11.
The first theme of his preface is his newly invented trapezoidal projection.
Critics, he says, will undoubtedly accuse him of either clumsiness or
rashness. Nam plane nos aut ignorasse quid egerimus aut temere ausas esse
tantum opus contaminare affirmabunt. But was not Homer, the father of
poetry, edited by Pisistratus, and Lucretius’ divinum opus by Cicero?
Readers, he adds, who have some inkling of geometry or cosmography will
applaud, since Ptolemy himself gave two [actually three]¹⁸ different
projections for a world map. One may comment that these trapezoidal
frames were also applied by Donnus Nicolaus to regional maps‚ for which
Ptolemy, as a simplification, proposed rectangular frames.

The other innovation of the Ulm edition was the inclusion of new
maps‚ tabulae novae or modernae. Two famous regions, Spain and Italy, the
editor points out, are in his time much better known topographically than
they were in antiquity. Therefore in addition to the Ptolemaic maps in
these areas, it seemed only right to incorporate new maps with the latest
available information for compan'son. There were also, he pointed out,
