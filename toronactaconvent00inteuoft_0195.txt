return of her daughter and her husband, but she is unaware of the
sacrifice arranged for by Jephthah and Iphis. Towards the end of the act
she goes offstage to return only in the final act, when the sacrifice has
been carried out and Jephthah has departed to Silo to reconcile himself
with God and the archpriest. Thus there is in the entire play not a single
encounter of husband and wife nor of mother and daughter.

In his preface Vondel has circumstantially justified this modification of
the intrigue. He blames Buchanan mostly for leaving the two-months’
delay of the sacrifice out of his Iepkthes. He does so expressly on the
authority of the poetics of Heinsius and Vossius. This somewhat formalis—
tic objection to Buchanan’s treatment of the biblical story is of course
inspired by the unity of time at stake here.⁸ Yet Vondel gladly adopted
the other poetic licences Buchanan had allowed himself; in many respects
he himself went much further. 1 think we should not let ourselves be
misled by these poetical or rather theological explanations on Vondel's
part. What he has changed in comparison with Buchanan’s concept, he
cannot account for himself in terms of contemporary poetics or theology.
His characters are the bearers of an emotionality that differs vastly from
that of Buchanan’s dramatis personae. Besides, he has filled in Buchanan’s
abstract scheme with so many details that he creates a realistic context in
which a confrontation between husband and wife to discuss the sacrifice
of their daughter becomes downright inconceivable.⁹ Elsewhere in his
preface Vondel betrays the emotional changes that are at the back of his
reshuffling of the intrigue. He writes: “This history also offers the true
nature of tragedy; the difficulty and ssoundering do not take place simply
between ordinary or distant relatives, but between next of kin, between
father, mother and daughter (an only daughter) and husband and wife.”
Vondel had strong opinions about matrimonial love, which he sees as the
terrestrial reflection of a cosmic force.¹⁰ His characters in Jeptha have

⁸ D. Heinsius, De tragoediae constitutione liber (ed. Lugd. Bac, 1643), chap. 17, p.
204: “In periodo autem Dramatis nos ipse [Buchanan] ludit. ad minimum enim
mensium duorum est. Duos enim deplorandam fuisse virginitatem, quis nescit?” The
same objection in G. J. Vossius, Poeticamm institutionum libri tres (ed. Amsterdam,
1647) 1, 11, 111, 2, p. 13.

⁹ Because of the foreseeable reaction of the mother any encounter between her
and Jephthah or Iphis is avoided at great pains by the environment; see vv. 785-98;
1290-13263 1897-1908. The actual reaction in νν. 1833-1882 is osa “cutting explosive
force and primitivism” in the words ol‘J.G. Bomhoff as quoted by Smit, op. cit. 2: 352.
