264 ENGELBERT KAEMPFER

Engelbert Kaempfer was among the most learned scholars of his era and
he surely was the most widely traveled. Upon leaving Moscow, the embassy
traveled overland to Astrachan on the Caspian Sea where it boarded ship
on an ill-starred voyage to Nisabad in Persia. Storm-tossed for twelve days,
Kaempfer and his colleagues finally reached land on 22 November 1683.
Kaempfer made diligent inquiries of the sailors and inhabitants of the
region of the Caspian. Not a single person had ever seen any whirlpool.
Clearly, the famous whirlpools of the Caspian Sea did not in fact exist.
Nor did the supposed underground channels.

Based on eyewitness investigation, Kaempfer, in the Amoem‘tatum
Exoticarum debunked the mythical whirlpools of the Caspian Sea.‘¹ But the
nagging question of how the huge volume of water which empties into the
Caspian Sea does in fact flow out still remained to be confronted. Before
addressing alternative solutions, Kaempfer had to dispose of the apparent
evidence presented by Father Avril. Relying on his own firsthand experi-
ence, Kaempfer disproved Father Avril’s contention that leaves from the
Salvia‚⁵ a plant supposedly found only on the shores of the Caspian Sea,
can also be found floating during the autumn months on the waters of the
Persian Gulf. Kaempfer spent two years on the Persian Gulf during which he
had studied Persian history and customs‚ and investigated‚ among other
things, Persian mummy, the torpedo fish of the Persian Gulf, and the
harvesting of asafetida.⁶ He took the opportunity to examine the vegetation
around the Persian Gulf with regard to Father Avril’s claim. Kaempfer con-
cluded that Salvia leaves are not found floating in the waters and that one of
two possible errors had occurred: either (a) Father Avn'l's informant had con-
fused the Latin word Alga‚⁷ which is found on the shores of the Persian
Gulf, with the Latin word Salvia3 or (b) Father Avril had mistaken the leaves
of Horau fruit mixed with Alga for the leaves of the Salvia Major which are

⁵ Salvia: a large genus, of the family Labiatae, which grows in temperate and
warmer climates. The name Salvia comes from the Latin salvo and suggests the
reputed healing qualities of sage, Salvia officinalis.

⁶ After voyaging from Russia and over the Caspian Sea, Kaempfer remained in
Persia from 22 November 1683 to 30 June 1688, when he sailed for India.

⁷ Alga: seaweed.
