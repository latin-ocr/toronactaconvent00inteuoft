67 2 MARc-ANTOINE MURET

qua versatur, aut certe cum eo quod agitur conjuncta et cohaerentia”
(150). He must teach clearly, methodically and in appropriate language.
The legal writers of forty years previously, for example, were often misin-
formed about antiquity, had a spirit of contradiction, filled their books
with extraneous matter from grammar and logie, lacked structure and
logical organization and wrote in bad Latin. Legal writing needs a clear,
unornamented everyday style.

The problem of what is relevant to any art was a very real one, as the
writings of Ramus and the controversies surrounding them make clear.
Muret does not enter into these controversies but he touches very closely
on the subject when he discusses the classical commonplace about the
perfect orator. In his preface to the second Catilinarian oration of Cicero,
he attacks the classical idea that the orator should have an encyclopedic
knowledge: “nam cum ita late patere oratoris officium tradidissent, ut ex
omni artium numero nullam relinquerent, qua non instructum esse eum
atque ornatum oportere dicerent, neque praeclarum illud nomen eloquen-
tis cuiquam tribuendum putarent, nisi qui idem et grammaticus esset, et
dialecticus, et earum rerum quae in naturae obscuritate positae sunt,
intelligens, et gubernandae reip. et gerendi belli peritus: eundemque esse
uellent et musicum, et geometren, et arithmeticum, et astrologum, et
medicum, et architectum: nulla ut res esset coelo, terra, mari, de qua non
ille copiosissime disputare, atque ornatissime posset’' (600-601). You
might as well insist that he be a good cook or a good cobbler because he
happens to mention food or shoes. “De iustis, iniustis, utilibus, inutilibus,
honestis, turpibus, dicere oratoris officium est: non de quadratis, et
circulis, de conis, et pyramidibus disputare” (602). The error is due to the
Stoic conception of the wise man and to Vitruvius’s idea of the architect.

It seems to me that there is an unresolved contradiction here in Muret's
thought since, as we have seen he did think that the teacher of literature
should strive for encyclopedic knowledge, and for him, as for many of his
contemporaries, the teacher is an orator, and indeed a ptime example of
the eloquent philosopher. Perhaps it is just that like Vives, Ramus, Sanc-
tius and others he believed that these other arts were in no sense part of
rhetoric and not strictly part of the role of the orator, and was alarmed at
the way some writers had extended Cicero’s and Quintilian’s ideas.⁹

⁹ As Robert Bolgar says in The Classical Heritage and its Beneficiaries (Cambridget
Cambridge Univ. Press, 1954), 346, “The whole of Humanism in its manifold varia-
tions was to some extent implicit in Quintilian's conception of the perfect orator. The
Institutio oratoria had described a discipline whose aim was to produce virtuous men
