PETER ZEEBERG 833

Among the poems in scientific works the most famous is the “Elegy to
Urania’', which ends his first published book, the De nova stella.⁴ This
dates from the same period as the letter 1 cited above, and does in fact
deal with the same problem: the noblemen’s hostility towards science.

With vague reminiscences of Ovid, Amores 321, the elegy describes how
the muse, Urania, reveals herself to Tycho while he is strolling in the
Scanian woods. She reproaches him for doing more work on chemistry
than on astronomy, and orders him to devote his life to the restitution (no
less) of her own neglected art. As a sign of this vocation she then presents
to him the new star.

After this splendid passage (the effect of which is based, as has been
pointed out by Karsten Friis-Jensen, on a sort of fusion of the symbolic
figure of the muse and the very real star) Tycho gives his own answer to
the muse. In a long monologue he describes the choice he has made
between aristocratic ideals and a life devoted to science. In this he obvi-
ously needs justification. Great parts of the introductory letters (a corre-
spondence between Tycho and a friend who was a professor in Copenha-
gen) have already been spent on defending the fact that a nobleman is
writing a book—here the defence is turned to counterattack.

First the traditional occupations of noblemen are listed in a most
polemic manner, starting with warfare, court service, politics and the
gathen'ng of riches, all described in terms of bragging, ambition, luxury,
etc. Next, without any differentiation, follow drinking, love, gambling,
hunting, riding. This, he declares, is what marks a nobleman; it seems, he
adds sarcastically‚ that nobility demands noble deeds:

Pluraque delectent alios, si plura supersunt,
More suo ingenuis quae peragenda viris.

Tycho's latin poetry is in Danish. The topic is treated in several Danish histories of
literature, especially in the latest: Karsten Friis-Jensen and Minna Skafte jensen in
Dans& Liuemturhsslorie, vol. 2 (Copenhagen, 1984), 404-12‚ but see also: oluf Friis, Den
damke Liuemturs Historie, vol. l (1938; repr„ Copenhagen, 1975): 448-50). — Special
studies: Peter Zeeberg, “Kemi og Kaerlighed, naturvidenskab i Tycho Brahes latin·
digtning”, in Liuemtur og Laeniom, ed. Mar-ianne Alenius and Peter Zeeberg. Renaes·
sancestudier, vol. 1 (Copenhagenz Museum Tusculanum Press, 1987), 149-61. This
article treats Tycho’s Ovidian Heroid “Urania Titani” and contains a list of the known
Latin poetry by Tycho Brahe, both extant and lost. Id., “Amor pa Hven, Tycho Brahes
