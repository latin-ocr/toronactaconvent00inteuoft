568 THE DEDICATORY LETTER As A GENRE

Leonello, presented Sulla in a way which would certainly enrage any Floren-
tine patriot who hailed him as the republican founder of their city.

There is one last point 1 wish to discuss here, and that is the role of
Manuel Chrysoloras in Guarino's prefaces. More often than with anyone
else, Guarino attributes to him virtues like munificentia and liberalitas,
which are princely virtues par excellence: to have brought back Greek
literature to the Latins is to bring light where it was dark, to awake to new
life the ancient splendors of Roman culture, and to enrich the whole of
Italy; in short, it is an act of munificence which equals the beneficia of any
sig-nore, and Chrysoloras, accordingly, deserved great gratitude.³¹ Gua-
rino, in a way, continued the work of his teacher, and his lavish praises of
Chrysoloras, though undoubtedly heartfelt, were meant also to reflect
credit on his own work, making his gratia, the translations, markedly more
significant.

³¹ Cf. No. 6: “. . . , ex cuius [Chrysolorae] opera et liberalitate manavit quicquid
graecarum hisce temporibus litterarum nostrates hausere”; the preface to the Alexan-
der and Caesar: “qui profugas dudum ex Latio litteras grecas ex innata liberalitate
reducens ad nostrates id in primis meditatus est, ut greca latinis imperciens tam
precioso patrimonio et immortali beneficio uniuersam ditaret Italiam. 0 singularem
munificencie claritatem, . . .”; No. 667: “Quocirca ingentes utrique Chrysolorae grates
habendae sunt laudesque cantandae, quorum beneficio. . . .'’
