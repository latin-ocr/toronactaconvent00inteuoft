over it and knew its protocol”.³ Long before death was at hand, Jorgen
Rosenkrantz prepared for the event; this is underlined in the first verses
of the poem, and the theme recurs as the moral at the end of it. Aries has
commented on the way in which the Book of Life changed during the
Middle Ages; from being God's register of those selected to join him in
Paradise, as it is in Revelations‚ it developed into an account book in
which each individual’s good and bad deeds were written for the final
account to be made up on the Day of Judgement. In the mediaeval Dies
Irae such a Book of Life is the basis for the judgement, and Aries also
gives examples where the book contains not the names of the redeemed
but those of the damned.‘¹ In the present twin poem, however, the Book
of Life is referred to with philological correctness as containing the names
of God's chosen. Compare the way the painting is inscribed with quota-
tions from the Bible, correctly copied and with references to chapters and
books for the viewer to control.⁵ The epitaph is made by and for people
who know their Bible. The Job passage has acquired a new meaning in its
new context. In a sense, the deceased's eagerness to see Christ with his
own eyes is truly humanist: with the distribution of reliable Bibles in print,
it had become possible to learn God's words by personal experience. A
further step towards its source would be to face Him.

Latin and Danish

The two versions adhere to poetical conventions from Latin and Danish
traditions respectively. The Latin poem consists of distichs‚ alternating
hexameters and iambic senars as in Horace’s sixteenth epode. This metre
is more ambitious than the much more common hexameter-pentameter
distichs‚ and still a suitable form for an inscription. The Danish version is
made up of ten-syllable rhyming couplets with four stresses in each line.
Since hexameters and senars have from twelve to seventeen syllables, the
Latin version is slightly longer than the Danish. That is surprising, consid-
ering that Latin normally needs fewer words than the vernaculars to

Testament the text follows the Vulgate, for the New Testament the first edition by
Erasmus (Baselz Frobenius 1516). The subsequent editions of Erasmus differ slightly
in the John passage.
