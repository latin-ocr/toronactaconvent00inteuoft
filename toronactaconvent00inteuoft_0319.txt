crusade to the Pope at Avignon, had in some measure heralded a revival.
In his Liber secretorum fidelium micis (1321),⁹ he had not only employed
Pietro Vesconte of Genoa to map the Mediterranean‚ but had himself
completely remodelled the map of the Holy Land, adding reference grid
squares whose numbers appear also in his text. Nevertheless, such a grid
was suitable only for 3 restricted area, and a return had to be made to
co-ordinates for the cartography of the known world.

Angelus’ other point is a much more doubtful one. He explains that
Manuel Chrysoloras had used the Latin title Geographia for Ptolemy’s title
Geographike Hyphegesis, which may be rendered “Manual of Geography.”
Angelus, however, preferred Cosmograpkia, and felt that his master would
have changed to that. Cosmos enim graece mundus latine, qui terram caelum·
que ipsum, quod per totum hoc opus tamquam reifundamentum adduc-itan plane
significat. This is quite the wrong approach. Ptolemy did not call his work
Geogmpkia, as Angelus implies‚ but by the Greek phrase above, of which
a possible Latin translation could have been Geographiae introductio, since
the word chartographia was not yet in use.¹⁰ Secondly, although the work
is by an astronomer and uses astronomical data, it is not about the uni·
verse, so that, as later editors saw, cosmographia is a misnomer.

As to Angelus’ translation of Ptolemy's text, on the one hand it rep-
resents no mean achievement, since no previous Latin translation of it and
no annotation were available‚ and Ptolemy's Greek is by no means easy.
On the other hand, after this translation had several times been revised,
mathematicians were more than ever complaining that Angelus did not
know mathematics well enough. As an example, he simply transliterated
Ptolemy’s word Ἐπιτὲταρτοζ meaning 5! 4 as epitetarti. This unfamiliar
word, referring in the context to the ratio of latitude to longitude at

Rhodes, was badly corrupted in Renaissance editions, even the editio

pn‘nceps (Vicenza, 1475) having epitertati (sic). It led to the 1932 translator,
E. L Stevenson,¹l mistaking the form Epitecartus, which he found, as if
it were a geographer's name. A later Renaissance edition had sesquiquarti,
which may have been more intelligible.

We may also think of Angelus’ failure to comment on what has been
called Ptolemy's major cartographic inaccuracy. Instead of accepting

Eratosthenes’ revised estimate of 252‚000 stades for the circumference of
