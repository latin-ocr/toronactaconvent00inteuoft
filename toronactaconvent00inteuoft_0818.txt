792 JESUIT DRAMA

About two thirds of the dramas listed seem to have been handed down
to posterity. As is customary with Jesuit dramas, they have come down to
us in the form ofperiochae-mostly bilingual programmes of four to sixteen
pages with an argumentum, a summary of the scenes and a list of the
actors—thus enabling the non-Latin speaking audience to follow the Latin
performances of the plays.

Eight dramas about Thomas More, Saint Edmund, Queen Languetta,
the Saints Archus, HerenuS, and Quardanus or the Scottish King Kenneth,
are extant in the form of Latin manuscripts.⁶ As far as I knOW, all have
remained unedited, although the editing of two More-dramas is now in
progress.

My words “seem to have been handed down’' refer to the fact that a
considerable number of the plays in question could not be found despite
the fact that we have clear evidence that a periocha was printed. Moreover,
many of the shelf-marks Jean Marie Valentin lists in his bibliography are
now obsolete and some of the archives he names do not have the periochae
in question.⁷ In view of this, I fear that at least ten percent of the listed
periochae must be classified as “lost'' because of damage during World War
II, or other losses.

As far as the remaining third of the dramas is concerned, not more
than the year and place of performance and the play's title—often in the
short Litterae Annuae-version—could be discovered. As we have no evi-
dence at all of the printing of a periocha or the existence of a manuscript,
these plays have also been classified as “lost?'' in my list.

By now the reader of the list must wonder if it really is a list of individ-
ual plays or merely a list of performances of a smaller group of original
plays. The striking similarities of several titles‚ e.g.‚ Thomas Morus, Grvss·
Cantzler von England (1750), and Thomas Morus, Kanzler in Engelland
(1764), or Carolus dises Namens der Erste Koem'g in Engelland, Schott- und
Irrland (1696), and Karl der erste aus dem Stuartischen Hause, Koem'g in
Engel-, Schott-‚ und Irrland (1771), seem to indicate that not all of the items
are independent or new treatments of a subject. Comparisons of periochae
prove, however, that simple reperformances of plays from other colleges
without any variations were an exceptio'n.⁸ In addition, Szarota’s edition

⁷ The librarians of the Ordensbibliothek Eichstatt and of the Provinzialbibliothek
Amberg informed me, for example, that their shelf-marks had been changed years ago
and in the Bibliotheque des Jesuites and the Paulinum Miinster 1 could not find the
periochae Valentin claims to be there.
