excused, and yet is rightly suffocated.”¹⁷ The lives of individuals and
communities are determined just as irreversibly as is the weather. But this
is a scientific truth, not a moral one. We have but a very incomplete
insight into causes and consequences, so that every step we take hovers
between hope and feam morally this is freedom. From Spinoza’s point of
view Jephthah has said too much in fright and sear: he was unable to
check his tongue, he was guided by wrong emotions. In taking the vow he
was the victim of his passions, in fulfilling it of superstition. He has to
tackle the dilemma whether or not to sacrifice his daughter. But is he
really free in his choice? Jephthah had been taught that it is essentia} to
carry out wat one has promised God, so he is unwavering in his loyalty.
The priest in Buchanan’s play confronts him with a wiser point of view: he
has committed a sin and he cannot undo it by perpetrating a crime. So,
we could add, he has to remain in a state of sin from which only God can
save him.¹⁸ But this thoughtJephthah cannot endure.

The man bitten by a mad dog suffers innocently but he is not in a
tragic situation. In Spinoza's way of thinking it could be called tragedy‚
when a man is steered by emotions, which are partly anchored in collec—
tive beliefs and superstitious, and then, by adhering to his principles with
fidelity and tenacity, causes his own and other people’s ruin. Τὴε concept
of an individua! conscience as an incentive to action is conspicuously ab·
sent from Spinoza’s philosophy; he knows only a guilty conscience (re-
morse, conscientiae monus) which he condemns as “animi impotentis . . .
signum.”¹⁹ Tragic man rouses pity and sympathy, even if we reject his
deeds and beliefs. In this sense Vondel’s Jephthah is hardly a good trag-ic
hero. But in this sense there is, 1 believe, a Spinozistic conception of
tragedy‚ It is represented, for example, in the story ofJuda el Fido, the
Spanish nobleman who went over to the Jewish saith as a consequence of
his Hebrew studies. Condemned to death by the Inquisin'on, he was
burned at the stake at Valladolid in 1644. In the midst of the flames he
began to sing the hymn of Psalm 31: “To thee, O God, I commit my

¹⁸ This last consequence is not drawn by Buchanan; it is of course wholly outside
Spinoza’s doctrine. But it is in Vondel, cf. v. 1031.
