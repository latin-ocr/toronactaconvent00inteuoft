326 HISTORIOGRAPHY AND HUMANISM

also worked on national history, but visible results were late in appearing.
The first humanist work of history by a Scandinavian was Johannes
Magnus's history of the Swedish kings, printed in 1554. Paradoxically,
Magnus's very ambitious Swedish history was to all intents and purposes
an answer to the publication in 1514 of a more than three-hundred-year-
old medieval chronicle, Saxo Grammaticus's history of Denmark. I shall
now try to give an idea of Saxo's role in the early Danish and Swedish
humanist movements?

First a few facts about Saxo’s work.³ Saxo wrote the history of the Danes
and their kings in sixteen books from the eponymous King Dan, some
twenty generations before Christ, and down to his own time, ending with
events that took place in 1185. The first nine books of the work are dominat-
ed by what we would call legendary material, but sources begin to flow more
abundantly in the Chn'stian period, comprising the last seven books from the
tenth century onwards. Saxo does not connect the Danes with any of the
mediterranean peoples, neither Greeks, Trojans, nor Old Testament tribes.
To Saxo the Danes are apparently autochthonous. Apart from mentioning
the birth of Christ, Saxo lacks explicit references to the categories of univer-
sal history. Saxo's history of Denmark is thus a secular, patn‘ou'c work of
history. Saxo wn'tes a highly polished and elegant Latin. His classical model
is not Cicero, but rather Silver Age writers such as Curtius Rufus and
Valerius Maximus. Moreover, the first part of the work is embellished with
poems in many classical quantitative metres. Saxo's metrical technique is
highly developed, and in the poems his models for language and subject
matter are the Roman poets of the Golden Age, particularly Vergil and Ι-Ιοηιεε).4
