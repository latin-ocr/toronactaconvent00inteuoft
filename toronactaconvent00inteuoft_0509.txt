mus called it a “rhythmus,” which meant “verse’' or “poem'’ but also had
overtones of the accentual, rhymed poems of the later Middle Ages.
Though Erasmus’s verse is quantitative, the accents do frequently coincide
with the long syllables of the iambs, as they often do in Prudentius. But
unlike Prudentius Erasmus also has more than a hint of rhyme or at least
half rhyme.²⁷ He also favors vivid and dramatic narrative over the denser
theologica! texture of Prudentius, which he understood full well, as his
commentaries on Prudentius show. The implied doxology in the two
concluding lines of the hymn to St. Ann is even more subtle than in the
explicit strophe at the end of the hymn to St. Gregory, where the persons
of the trinity are invoked. “Indivisa quibus Numinis unitas l Est sub
nomine triplici'' (“who are united indivisibly in their divinity under the
diversity of a triple name”).²⁸ “Triplici nomine,” which refers to the
three different names, is singular and echoes “numinis,” their single
godhead. At the end of the hymn to Ann we are told that if Ann asks help
for us from Mary, and Mary asks it from her son, he will not refuse her,
“Neque filio negat pater, s Amans et ipse filium’' (“nor will the father
refuse his son, for he, too, loves his son'’).²⁹ Τὴε suggestion of the Holy
Spirit, the love between the father and the son, completes the Trinitarian
theme in an appropriate familial context.

But Erasmus’s most daring and original experimentation with liturgica}
hymnology is to be found in his Lorettan sequence. To see how this is so,
it is necessary to sketch briefly how the sequence evolved from its origin
in the ninth century until the time of Erasmus.³⁰ In its earliest form the
text of sequences typically consisted of a series of prose couplets of
unequal length, with a single line at the beginning and at the end. Both
lines in each couplet had an equal number of syllables so that both could
be sung to the same melody. The form emerged when words were provid-
ed for long melodies that had been added to the last syllable of the
alleluia after the gradual of the mass. As perfected by Notker of St. Gall in
the late ninth century, the lines of the couplets, though they had no rhyme
or metrical feet, did frequently match each other in accentual patterns and

complicated and disputed, but the main outlines of what was available to Erasmus are
clear enough.
