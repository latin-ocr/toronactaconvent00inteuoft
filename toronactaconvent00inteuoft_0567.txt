HENK NELLEN AND EleN RABBIE 543

Damnatus aliis ipse neminem damnat,
modestiaeque limitem premens donat
nunc verba vero, nunc silentium paci.

Grotius points out that Arminius propagated and tried to follow these
rules until the very end of his life, and then concludes the poem with a
number of verses which could be interpreted as a direct attack on Goma-
rus: he presents Arminius as praying in heaven that the theologians may
strive for unity rather than bragging about their own personal discoveries:

Det [sc. Deus] non loquentes sua reperta doctores;
det consonantes semper omnium linguas

aut corda saltem, praepotente vi flammae
caliginosas litium fuget sordes,

ut spiret unum tota civitas Christi

vitamque terris approbet, fidem caelo.

This poem was placed after the text of the funeral oration, which was
delivered on 22 October 1609 by Petrus Bestius, a co—religionist of Armi-
nius, and which was published in that same year.¹¹ In the heated atmo-
sphere of those days such an unequivocal declaration of support could not
remain without repercussions. Immediately Bestius clashed with the
implacable Gomarus and was forced to defend Arminius's reputation in a
lengthy and sharp exchange of polemics. For Grotius, too, the publication
caused trouble: owing to either ill will or negligence on the part of Bertius
or his assistants, Grotius’s poem was published with a number of printing
errors. Most of these turned out to be harmless, but one passage of the
σκάζων now suggested that Arminius alone (solus) had felt love for the
kingdom of heaven, whereas the poet had meant to say that Arminius had
been full of love (totus) for it.¹²

When Gomarus saw the poem, he had to admit that it was moderate in
message and beautiful in style, but-not surprisingly—was annoyed by the
passage mentioned above, as it seemed to shed a dubious light on his role

¹¹ See note 9 above.

¹² Molhuysen, Bw I, p. XIX, assumes ill will on Bertius‘s part, although there is no
clear evidence for this. The editio prirweps edited by Bertius contains a number of other
deviations from the text which had been authorised and was later published by
Grotius. It cannot, therefore, be ruled out that Bertius was speaking the truth when
he reduced the entire business to an annoying misunderstanding (BW 1, 179 d.d.
21-12-1609): either the differenccs were due to negligence on the part of the copyist
who had transcribed Grotius’s autogr-aph for the printer or they were simply the result
of printing errors.
