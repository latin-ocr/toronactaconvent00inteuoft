enduring desire to live godly-that is what constant prayer means.¹² A
prayer in the narrow sense, whether said aloud or not, must meet one
condition: it should come straight from the beart and if it does, it is not
bound to a particular place. The “colloquy with God”—one of Erasmus’s
definitions of praying¹³—can be conducted anywhere; any place can be
turned into a shn‘ne: bedroom‚ kitchen‚ workshop, ship, carriage, bath,
even the “latrina.” In essence, the heart is the temple of God.¹⁴

As 1 mentioned earlier, Erasmus condemns “battologiass’ by which he
means meaningless repetitions. Prayers that arise from passionate emo-
tions, however, can be full of repetitions, like the Psalms. These are,
according to Erasmus, forms of “holy battologia.”¹⁵ Praying methods
that are based on repetition, such as the Rosary and the Litanies, are not
mentioned by Erasmus in this context. Such forms of praying he consid-
ered to be an aid for the weak at best, although heis sympathetic towards
the Office of the Holy Cross,¹⁶ doubtless because it was christocentric
and short.

Viewed against this background, Erasmus's Paean to the Holy Virgin
and his Obsecratio¹⁷ seem rather incongruous. The Paean consists mostly
of a list of Mary‘s traditional titles of honor: “the new Eve,’' “the tower of
David,'' etc. and of less traditional (we would say “Ciceronian‘’) titles, like
“the true Diana.”¹⁸ Τὴε obsecratio addresses Mary as the “Star of the
Sea,” the only hope of the mortals who drift about on the dangerous seas
of life in the frail ship of their body.¹⁹ Half of the Obsecratio is in the
nature of a litany, invoking Mary in some 60 “obsecrationes,” for instance:
“by your conception, by your birth, by your childhood, your purity,
humility,” etc. And as in medieval prayerbooks, the stages of Christ's
