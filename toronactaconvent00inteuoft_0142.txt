124 PROBATI AUTORES

for example, on the translation of eulogemene by benedicta, he noted that
“benedictus and maledictus are not found in Latin authors in the sense of
praiseworthy and blameworthy‚ yet we must wink at some things of this
kind, whether we want to or not, because they are too well established and
cannot be changed without creating a stir.”¹¹ Of course the translator
ought to be consistent in the use of scriptural idiom: “If it is Christian to
disregard Latin usage in these cases, to adopt a foreign idiom and to
create a special new Christian idiom, why is it not done in all other cases
as well? For what is correct and done judiciously must be done in each
case'’ (LB VI 108E).

Similarly Erasmus commented on the peculiar use of infidelis: “Infidelis
is not Latin, but in Scripture it is used to denote someone who does not
believe” (LB VI 562F). Elsewhere he notes that collectis in the sense of
collatione was not classica! Latin but “firmly established’‘ in church usage
(LB VI 744E). Sacramentum was another word that had taken on a special
meaning in scriptural texts. As Erasmus explained, it had not always had
the same meaning of “sacrament.'’ “In antiquity sacramentum was an oath
or a religious obligation'’ (LB VI 8553). A similar case was the word
honorare, which meant “to honour” in classica} Latin, but “according to
scriptura} usage pertains more to sustenance than to honour” (LB VI
8113). In these cases, then, Erasmus was willing to make concessions to the
biblical idiom. In many others, however, he saw no mitigating circumstanc-
es to justify the Vulgate translator’s solecisms and deviations from the
classical norm. In such cases he did not hesitate to correct the text and
refer readers to the usage of what he termed probi or probati autores.
Unfortunately Erasmus does not oblige us with a definition or list of
whom he considered standard authors, but in De ratione studii he enumer-
ated authors that might serve as models to young students. Among the
Greeks he assigned “first place to Lucian, second to Demosthenes, and
third to Herodotus; again, among the poets, first place to Aristophanes,
second to Homer, third to Euripides. . . . Among Latin writers who is more
valuable as a standard of language than Terence? Should someone
think that a feW‚ selected comedies of Plautus, free from impropriety
should be added to the above, 1 would personally not demur. Second
place will go to Virgil, third to Horace, fourth to Cicero, and fifth to

Caesar. If someone thinks that Sallust should be included, 1 would not
offer much objection’' (CWE 24, p. 669:5-16). This provides the reader

¹¹ LB VI 223F3 note, however, that at 565D-E (Rom. 1:25) Erasmus changes the
Vulgate’s benedictus (translating eulogetos) to laudandus, commenting apologetically:
Adeo passim receptum est in Sacris Litteris ut vix liceat mutare.
