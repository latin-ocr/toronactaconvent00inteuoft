ECKHARD BERNSTEIN 255

German humanists, but also their considerable achievements. At a time
when humanists at most German universities were tolerated as mere
outsiders, Hutten with this veritable “Who’s Who'’ of German humanism
in 1510 tried to persuade others, and perhaps himself, what a powerful
and respectable group the humanists in reality were.

But were the humanists really such a cohesive group as Hutten wants
his readers to believe? To be sure, there were numerous friendships
between individual humanists. It is also true that Conrad Celtis, with
considerable organizational talent, had founded so-called literary “sodalita-
tes.'' But with his death in 1508 these had withered away, and they had
been limited to southern Germany anyhow, with some branches in Bohe-
mia and Hungary. The fact is that by 1510 the German humanists were
quite a disparate group, even if we only look at Hutten’s list. The reasons
for that were as van'ed as the humanists themselves, There were genera-
tional differences: on the one hand there were the older humanists in
their fifties and sixties (Wimpfeling was 60, Reuchlin 56, and Brant 52), οη
the other hand the younger humanist in their twenties (Richard Crocus
was 21, Wolfgang Angst 25, and Hutten himself 22 years old). There were
also considerable ideological differences: while Jakob von Gouda, for
instance, was a pious churchman, Mutianus Rufus favored a paganistic
Neoplatonism. There were sociological differences: Eitelwolf von stein,
Hutten and Hermann von dem Busche came from aristocratic families,
while Crotus Rubeanus and Eobanus Hessus were the sons of peasants.
Some humanists, finally, indulged in humanistjc studies only in their
leisure time as a “hobby‚” others pursued them with the intensity of a full-
time vocation. To say that this heterogeneous company constituted a
unified front was highly questionable. But this is of course precisely what
Hutten was saying. What he had created with this catalogue was not an
actual description, but a fiction, a myth—the myth of the strength, unity,
and cohesiveness of the German humanist movement.

It would be tempting to stylize the conflict Hutten thematized in the
Querelae as one between humanism and scholasticism. There is, however,
no textual basis for such an attempt. To be sure, on the one hand there is
Hutten and the allegedly combined forces of the German humanists. But
who is on the other? Hennig thz — an insignificant law professor in a
provincial German university town? Hutten’s description of him as a
mean, sadistic and vindictive old lecher is viciously one—sided. That Lotz is
also an enemy of the muses does not make him a representative of
scholasticism. In other words, at this point the humanism-scholasticism
conflict does not interest Ulrich von Hutten. The notion of the strength
of humanism precedes the Reuchlin affair and sprang, at this time, from
