would like to note that the wording of the penitent’s prayer and of the
prayer to be said before holy communion is such that no adherent of the
Reformation could have had any qualms about using them.

Erasmus composed the so-called Eiaculationes from bible texts, accord-
ing to the method he had recommended in the Modus orandi.³⁷ The
dedication (the second one) discusses only this type of short prayer:³⁸
prayers composed like a mosaic of bible texts and intended for use in all
kinds of situations. There are twenty—two of these short prayers, some of
them consisting only of a single line. These are followed by another
thirteen short prayers and the early prayer to Jesus of about 1500.

This last prayer being twenty-five pages long, it obviously does not
belong to the category of “eiaculationes.’' However, its typographical
design may easily create the impression that it does belong there: the large
capitals in which the title “Eiaculationes'‘ is printed would seem to indi—
cate that it is a heading to all of the following text. It is only when we get
to the Precatio Dominica, that we encounter these large capitals again in the
title. Traces of this typography are to be found also in the Clericus—edition
and there too it creates the impression that the Precatio ad Iesum is to be
counted among the “eiaculationes.'’ However, the Maire-edition of 1641
did not make this mistake.

Do the thirteen prayers following the biblical prayers belong to the
category of “eiaculationes” as well? In the dedication, only the biblical
prayers are mentioned. We may assume, however, that this group of
thirteen prayers is actually yet another set of “eiaculationes.'’ The question
to be asked here is: can these prayers be considered “precationes novae'’?

In the Amsterdamedition of the Colloquia (ASD Ι, 3), it is pointed out
that of the prayers included in the Colloquies three short ones were to be
printed in the Precationes of 1535.³⁹ One might think, then, that Erasmus
had added the other ten prayers around 1535. But in this case, too, the
running titles of the editio princeps again suggest otherwise. The biblical
prayers have “Eiaculationes e scriptura sacra” as their running title,

³⁸ Ep. 2995, lines 3-5: “Eas appelavimus Eiaculationes, quod breves quidem sint,
sed quoniam erumpunt ab ardenti mentis affectu, celerius penetrant in coelum.” Cf.
the colloquy “Epicureus‚” ASD 1, 3: p. 733, lines 489-90: “Penetrat autem et brevis
precatio coelum . . .'' (for the medieval proverb “brevis oratio penetrat coelos'’ see
