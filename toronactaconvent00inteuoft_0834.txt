808 VIVES'S THEORY OF DELIBERATIVE ORATORY

so, Vives presents his own theory on the bonum, especially the bonum per
se. First of all, Vives excludes, as already mentioned, the utile from the
goals to aim at.²⁵ Secondly, Vives’s definition of honestum is entirely
different from Cicero’s and illustrates his concern for Christian values.
Honestum comprises first of all things connected with God, such as saith or
knowledge and adoration of the Divine; moreover, it covers things con-
nected with human beings, among which are mentioned first of all the
social values expressed in the Gospel, such as love for one’s neighbor,
justice and beneficence. Finally, Vives allows room for the classical values,
such as glory and power, but he qualifies their validity carefully.²⁶

Thus it becomes clear that to Vives much, if not all, of the deliberative
process is to be centered around Christian values. Interestingly, this focus
also influences significantly Vives's precepts on the use of exempla and the
handling of emotions, the affectus. As to the exempla, Vives simply stresses
that they must come from primarily Christian sources.²⁷

Quintilian speaks of the importance of arousing emotions, such as
anger, sear, ambition, hatred and reconciliation, thus voicing a widely
accepted view in ancient rhetorical theory.²⁸ Vives on his part says that
emotions must not be aroused, for this would be contrary to the necessity
of gravity and probity. This does not mean, however, that emotions should
be absent from the deliberative speech—for then the discourse would

²⁵ ‘⁸ . . . et inter honestum quidem ac utile, si modo Christianos nos esse memini-

mus, nulla erit controversia: olim Romanus populus saepe numero in deliberationibus
illud usurpabat, Vincat utilitas . . . nos vero dicamus, Honesms vincat, seu potius, vincat
religio” (ed. Mayansius, 251). Vives may have in mind Quint„ Inst. 3.8.30‚ where an
example is given from Roman history illustrating the prevalance of the utile over the
honestum. Vives describes the category os the utile as follows: “illa . . . praecipua, quae
ad tuendam vitam sunt reperta, nec in praesens modo comparantur, sed in posterum
quoque prosunt . . . quae ad delicias, voluptatesque per omnes sensus, et quae animo
sunt jucunda,” and finally “speciosa et magnifica” (ed. Mayansius, 244).

²⁶ “In honesto potissima esse convenit quae ad Deum pertinent; hujus generis sunt
pietas, ardor rerum supremarum, cognitio et adoratio illius omnipotentis naturae,
quam cognitionem Dominus in Evangelio pronuntiat esse vitam aeternam . . . secun·
dum locum obtinent quae ad homines, ut caritas in illos, quod est Christi praeceptum,
tum justitia, propulsatio injuriae, liberalitas, beneficentia . . . post haec acumen ingenii,
judicium, eruditio, dignitas, honor, laus, gloria, gratia, auctoritas, potentia, et per
quam nonnulla ex his parantur generis claritudo; quae si ultro contigerint, et moder-
ate utaris, in emolumentum aliorum, pulchrae res sunt, et magnificae . . .” (ed.
Mayansius, 243).

²⁷ Ed. Mayansius, 254. Vives also allows didactic fables, which figured among the
standard exempla in ancient theory and practice.
