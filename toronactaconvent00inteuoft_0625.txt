STELLA P. REVARD 601

Me couronner la teste,

De chapeaux que m'a preste
La delicate main

D’une de que soudain

Bras δε mains il retienne
Luy disant. Toute mienne,
Ma mignarde, mon coeur
Qui fais tante rigueur

Ma barbotante bouche
Ikvres sur levres bouche.¹³

Probably it is this same lyric that the English poet Robert Herrick is
imitating in his “A Lyrick to Mirth.” Eliminating the dismissal of wealth
and summoning love and wine, he begins with the last clement of the
Greek original, the determination to enjoy life while time permits.

While the milder Fates consent,

Let’s enjoy our merryment:

Drink, and dance, and pipe, and play;
Kisse our Dollies night and day:
Crown'd with clusters of the Vine;
Let us sit, and quaffe our wine;

Call on Bacchus; chaunt his praise;
shake the Thysse, and bite the Bayes:
Rouze Anacreon from the dead;

And return him drunk to bed:¹⁴

For Cowley also the call to pleasure becomes the dominant motis of the
anacreontic. He transposes the opening line of the Greek to line 6 and re-
duces the dismissa] of n’ches to a single sentence: “we contemn s Gyge’s
wealthy Diadem’‘ (5-6). Joining the command to bind the temples with
roses from line 8 of the original with he call for wine found in no. 6 or
no, 21 of Estienne's sequence (poems Cowley does not directly translate),

Cowley begins:

Fill the Bowl with rosie Wine,
Around our temples Roses twine‚
