JAMEs v. MEHL 477

Cologne Dominicans, who had recently opposed Reuchlin and placed
restrictions on the teaching of humanistic subjects. Instead, Murmellius
advocated the study of the so-called wisdom books of the Old Testament—
Psalms, Proverbs‚ Ecclesiasticus-together with the gospels‚ as the best way
for students to learn “doctrina” (32). Those Old Testament books con-
tained religious truth expressed as “divine poetry.’' He quoted from the
Church fathers Eusebius (37) and Jerome (33-36, 43-45)‚ the latter
claiming that the writings of Pindar, Alcaeus, and Sappho were nearly
equal to the metered wisdom contained in the Hebrew scriptures (44).
Among the moderns, Murmellius referred to Erasmus’ Par-adesis (42),
Baptista Mantuanus' Apologeticon (47-48), and especially Giovani Pico della
Mirandola’s biblical commentarios (39-41, 49-50). In these wayS‚ Murmel-
lius was recommending a kind of biblical humanism to replace the scholas-
tic approach to theologica] study.

He next extended his argument to include the jurists, focusing on the
canon lawyers and the grammarians who supported them, who had been
so responsible for corrupting Latin usage. As an illustration of the change,
Murmellius included a passage from Angelo Poliziano, where it is pointed
out that grammarians are no longer called “grammatici,’' but “grammatist-
ae,” and the educated men of letters no longer “litterati,” but rather
“litteratores’' (52). A major cause of such corruptions of the language, ac-
cording to Murmellius, was the continuing widespread use of faulty Latin
grammar textbooks. He even provided a list of the worst offenders: “Isi-
dorus, auctor alioqui pius et non omnino contemnendus, Papias, Eberardus,
Hugutio, Catholicon, Mammaetractus, Aimo, Breviloquw, Gemma gemmarum,
Vocabularim remm‚Joannes Garlandinus, Nicolaus Lyranus, Accursius, Aurea
legendo, Glossulae demutor-um, Glossa notabilis et id genus reliqua‘’ (54). Bomer
has provided a precise identification of these “unlearned expositors of
words.’'²⁵ Several of these medieval gmmmarians are also decried in Valla’s
Elegantiae and Mantuanus' Apobgeticon (55-56).

As a corrective to those medieval grammarians, whose glosses had ob-
scured the true meaning of the classical languages, Murmellius himself
contributed two chapters filled with useful references for the reader. In
one he recommended the best dictionaries, lexicons, and other works
dealing with questions of philology, to be consulted when reading classica}
texts (57). Besides such older, but still helpful, works as Varro, Festus
Pompeius, Aulus Gellius, Macrobius, and Priscian, Murmellius approved
the most current works of scholarship by Renaissance humanists, includ-
