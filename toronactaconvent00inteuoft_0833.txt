ambition (voluntas) and capability (familias) must be taken into account.
Vives measures the whole area of human actions on a moral scale defined
by two oppositeS, good and bad. Ultimately‚ he says, every deliberation is
concerned with just these two notions, for man’s voluntas is by nature
directed towards the good.¹⁹ The emphasis on the natural morality of
man, which is one of the premises of Vives's entire philosophical
thought,²⁰ induces an adaptation of the classica} analysis of the rhetorical
goals to aim at (res expetendae) and thus also modifies Vives’s general
viewpoints on the loci. The ancients were not entirely consistent in their
treatment of this subject. Aristotle equates the good with the useful and
states that the useful is the main goal in deliberative oratory.²l Cicero
and Quintilian, both following the Stoic tradition, make a distinction
between the honest and the useful and accept that either one of these can
legitimately be a goal to strive for‚²² although they claim that of course
the honest is the more important goal.²³ Vives focuses on the bonum and
subdivides it, in Aristotelian fashion, into bonum per se or honestum and
bonum propter aliud or utile. He critically discusses Cicero's analysis of these
concepts in the second book of De inventione.²‘¹ In the process of doing

¹⁹ “. . . quoniam omnia ad voluntatem deliberantis referuntur, illud enim modo

quaeritur, ut velit, aut nolit, voluntasque in bonum semper fertur, . . . fit, ut omnis
deliberatio sit de bono, et hinc de contrario hujus malo . . .” (ed. Mayansius‚ 242).

istic Emphasis”). Also quite illustrative of Vives's claim that man's will is directed by
nature towards the good is the introduction to book 111 of De anima et vita, dealing
with the affectiones: “Condidit omnia Rex naturae, ut illis de suo impartiretur esse, quo
essent, de sua vero beatitudine, ut bene essent . . . ad quae sua assequenda et
conservanda munia, attribuit facultates, ad esse quidem, pronitatem, ut se quicque ab
injuria tueatur corrumpentis, quoad ejus possit efficere, ad bene autem esse, ap-
petitum boni, aversionem a malo, ut in bonum feratur appetitus, a malo declinet et

fugiat . . .” (ed. Mayansius, 3:421).

²² See Cicero, Off. 1.9-10 for the Stoic viewpoints. In Inv. 2.52.157-8 Cicero
discerns three genera rerum expetendarum, the honesta, things to be sought for their own
sake, such as vinus, scientia or veritas, the utilia, things to be aimed at for their
practical use, such as pemmia, and things which are mixed, such as amicitia and bona
existimatio, which are also termed honesta. Quintilian also accepts that either honestum
or utile is a legitimate aim to strive for (Inst. 3330). Compare also, e.g., Erasmus's
discussion of this topic in De conscribendis epistolis; he distinguishes six groups of loci,
honestum, utile, tutum, iucundum, facile, necessarium (ASD 1, 2 (1971), ed.J.-Cl. Margolin‚
366; honestum is discussed on pp. 366-69, utile on 369-70‚ tutum, iucundum, facile and
necessarium are explained briessy on 399).
