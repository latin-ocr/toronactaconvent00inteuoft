212 FACTION VERSUS FICTION

finished in 1405, he points out that through poetry a new sort of reality is
created, which is ficta, as opposed to existing reality, i.e.‚ facta.⁸

Alberti, to be true, after having laid down, in the first book of his
treatise, the rules for the technical execution of the picture, was mostly
concerned in the remaining two books with the transfer of the poetic and
rhetorical standards and models of Antiquity into his chosen field of
painting‚ Nothing would have occurred more easily to him than to draw
for his terminology also upon the writing on literature of his own day, to
use it for his own specific purpose, translating it at the same time into the
vernacular.

But let us turn, then, to the Latin text and to the term imitare. As is
evidenced through every page of his treatise, Alberti was well versed in the
ancient writers on the visual arts and made extensive use of his knowl-
edge. So he often exemplifies his own views by referring to artists or
works of art mentioned by Pliny the Elder in the Historia Naturalis.⁹
Likewise, he rephrases one of the Vitruvian passages, in the De Archi-
tectura, on the formation of pictorial depth illusion to suit the description
of his own linear perspective construction.¹⁰

In Vitruvius the word imitare is used about the rendering of stone
incrustation in the pictorial wall decoration of the 1 Pompeiianic Style, it
being an imitation of nature. Pliny, however, uses the term variously to
signify both the imitation of nature and of the works of other artists. In
these two, as in other Roman authors, the quality of a piece of art is duly
praised on behalf of its life likeness, vivum similis, or its truthfulness to
nature, similitudo veritatis. lt was, indeed, this kind of imitative skill which
the Ancients admired in the two Greek painters, Zeoxis and Parhasios, as
shown in the anecdote told by Pliny about their painting‚ one a basket of
grapes, the other a curtain seemingly drawn before the picture, to see
whose rendering of nature was the more deceiving.¹¹ The idea of imita-

⁹ Most of the editions and translations of the treatise comment on this fact. It is

typical for Alberti, however, that he more often than not cautiously conceals his
sources.

extremely sophisticated re-use of the Vitruvian text.

¹¹ The anecdote is told in Nat. Hist. (IX, XXXV, 65). It describes the wager

commonly dealt with by later authors on the arts. The fact that it does not seem to
have attracted Alberti's attention may support the point made in this paper.
