698 ΤΗΕ EMBLEMS OF CRANACH AND VAENIUS

German artist Lukas Cranach the Elder (1472-1553). We know that
Cranach and his son produced for wealthy buyers a number of such
painted emblems, which were usually on the subjects of “Hercules and
Omphale'' or “Venus consoling Cupid who has been stung by bees.” Each
of these oil paintings contains either a Latin epigram, which comments on
the visual scene, or simply a motto to indicate the topos, while the picture
itself makes the artist’s commentary clear in visual terms.1 Ῑ shall demon-
strate here a philosophical shift in the attitude of emblematists in northern
Europe toward the theme of the Herculean lover between the
mid—sixteenth century when Cranach was at work in Saxony and the early
seventeenth century when Otto van Veen, or Vaenius, published his
trilingual Emblemes ofLove in Antwerp.²

Appearing in 1608, the English edition of this beautifully illustrated
book contains verses also in Latin and Italian. Another edition of the same
year offers the same poems in Latin, Dutch, and French versions. The
English translator of the Amorum Emblemata is believed to have been
Richard Verstegan, an Englishman of Dutch descent.³ Primarily an artist,
Vaenius himself was a student of the painter Federigo Zuccari for seven
years in Rome, and he later became Rubens' master in the Netherlands
between the years 1596 and 1600. According to Mario Praz, “Vaenius's
Cupids'' were certainly inspired by those of Raphael's “Logge'' seen
during his student years in Rome?¹ Moreover‚ like the sonneteers of the
period, Vaenius as a humanist took a Neoplatonic view of the figure of
Cupid or Amor, who then became for him an entirely appropriate com-
panion for virtuous Hercules. But, as we shall see, the most intriguing
aspect of van Veen's Emblemes osLove is the way in which the Netherlandish
artist conflates various Herculean topoi to arrive at a very different version
of the Herculean lover from that of Cranach and other earlier emblematists.

Hercules is, of course, best known in Western art and literature for his
heroic virtue rather than for his exploits as a lover (fig. 1). Indeed a
favorite Renaissance topos concerns the hero's decision to turn resolutely
