84 THOMAS sTAPLEToN’s USE OF MORE's ENGLISH w0RKs

Ordained a priest during the reign of Mary (1558) with a Β.Α. from
New College, Oxford (1556), he received his D.D. in 1571 from the Uni-
versity of Douai, where he also taught until Philip 11 appointed him (1590)
Regius Professor of Sacred Scripture at Louvain, where he died on 12 Oc-
tober 1598. He was in great demand as a preacher, and the lives of his
first two Thomases had their nuclei in panegyrics he had delivered on
their feastdays, 21 and 29 December 1586. His spiritual fervor included a
brave attempt at becoming aJesuit (1585-1586). He never advanced to pro-
fession but retained an admin'ng envy toward such confessors of the saith as
Edmund Campion, and not a few Douai students of his who crossed the
channel into danger right after their ordination. The leitmon'v of his hagio-
graphic trilogy is the three Thomases‘ shared glory of martyrdom.

As a controversialist, Stapleton is hardly inferior to his better known
contemporary, St. Robert Bellarmine, and there is a polemical edge to all
his works, even his biographies. Itis especially perceptible in his rehabilita-
tion of the vilified St. Thomas Becket. In the Vita Mori the apologetic
concern never comes obtrusively to the fore. Of course, a confident tone
and a belligerent stance were not considered at all indecorous in an aging
professor during the early post-Tridentine era, when the Catholic Church
was, if ever it was, “ecclesia in terris militans.” And a similar spirit per-
vades the works of Protestant controversialists and martyrologists in the
same generation, such asJohn Foxe’s Acts and Monuments.

Yet More's multi-faceted greatness prevents Stapleton from being
haunted by the bloody end of his hero. Though “the glory of God and the
edification of the reader” are the motives of his work, “pleasure’' is also
an aim added in the very first sentence of the proemium (“voluptatem
singularem’‘). More’s own “elegantia et suavitas’' are ideals Stapleton
wishes to pursue in conjuring up the full man. Utopia is the first book he
quotes from, and More’s witty sayings and merry tales claim all of chapter
13 (“Acute et facete dicta vel responsa”).

Stapleton's sources for Vita Mori were many and manifold: Roper’s
memoir via Harpsfield's unpublished biography, Erasmus’ correspon-
dence, Pole's Pro unitate, Sander's influential account of the Anglican
schism, and other “docti viri” (Cochlaeus, Giovio and others, even the
Lutheran Rivius), whose testimonies fill the last chapter of Vita Mori.
Stapleton’s major set of documents are some thirty letters which came into
his hands from More’s secretaryJohn Harris. These might well have been
lost forever if Stapleton had not incorporated them into his biography.
They were written by Colet, Fisher, Tunstal‚ Gunnell, Bishop Veysey, and
other friends and colleagues of More's. But for the sake of a closer look
at Stapleton’s Vita Mori, the scope of this essay will be limited to the use
