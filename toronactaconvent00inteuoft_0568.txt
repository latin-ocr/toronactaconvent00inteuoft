544 GROTIUS'S FAME As A POET

in the dispute with Arminius. Gomarus was afraid that an outsider like
Grotius would be taken at his word, whereas he himself would automati·
cally be portrayed as partia] and, therefore, untrustworthy. Through a
mutual acquaintance Gomarus communicated his annoyance to
Grotius,¹³ who then had a corrected version of the epicedium published,
in the introduction to which Bertius's behaviour was criticised.¹⁴ More-
over‚ he did his best to apologise to the offended theologian. In a letter to
Gomarus¹⁵ he argued that he had by no means intended to insult him.
He had only wanted to praise Arminius's talent, eloquence and peaceful-
ness. As for the dispute between the two scholars, Grotius said that he did
not quite understand the details, but that he was merely concerned with
the unity of the church, which had to be preserved in spite of any differ-
ence of ορίῐιίοῐι.16

In this letter, the twenty-six-year-old Grotius displays such self-confi-
dence that it must have seemed outright arrogance to the strict Gomarus;
its tone is similar to that of the poem, which must have been difficult to
swallow for a man such as Gomarus, even without the printing error,
whether intentional or otherwise.

It may be concluded that the nature of Grotius's poem is that of a
manifesto: here, for the first time, he expresses his favourite view on the
unity of the church, an ideal which would continue to inspire him all his
life. As such, this occasional poem goes beyond its immediate “occasion'’
and its perfunctory character. The commotion which it brought about
shows that Grotius's popularity and influence as a poet were such that
someone who was directly involved, like Gomarus, felt obliged to respond.
Coincidentally, as a result of the matter of Bertius and the printing error,
it became clear that poems such as that discussed here were addressed to
the forum of public opinion, and that Grotius's voice did in fact count. In
this way, an occasional poem can practically function as a political or
religious manifesto.

Our second example, a poem dating from a much later period, from
1636, is similar to the Arminius-poem in that it contains a statement of
principles, as a result of which it rises above its formal status of occasional

scio nec si sciam temere me interponam. Habet ista res suos iudices . . . Dolent mihi
haec dissidia. Sed numquam diu fuit ecclesia sine illis, numquam erit. Restat ut
feramus alter alterum. . . .”
