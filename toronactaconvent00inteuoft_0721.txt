Dutchmen—Junius, Gruter, and Scriverius.²²

Taken collectively, the commentaries, in addition to shedding light on
particular epigrams, establish a fuller image of the Renaissance Martial,
one that is at odds with the popular Renaissance image of him merely as
a witty satirist that we find in vernacular imitations of the day. In contrast,
we see here a poet recognized to be in the mainstream of the traditional
imitative process. The commentators are far-reaching in recording gemina
dicta, covering not only similarities of expression but metaphors and
places. They draw from Catullus and mostly the Augustan poets‚ but also
mention, among others, both Greek and Latin Anthologies, the Disticha
Catonis, the fables of Publilius Syrus, the Priapea, and Renaissance writers
as well.

Among prose writers the favorites are from the Silver Age. A noticeable
characteristic of the commentaries is their persistence in aligning, in over
200 places, the style and substance of Martial with the works of Seneca, an
association that has largely been lost today. New readings of particular
lines and whole epigrams emerge when bathed in the light of Stoic
philosophy and Senecan style.

The rhetorical analysis of the epigrams observed in the commentaries
further serves to support certain conclusions about the epigram genre
itself in the Renaissance and to dispel popular misconceptions about the
form in the Renaissance.1n a theory derived from Lessing’s 1771 essay, the
epigram is commonly thought of today as a short, witty, often satirical
poem consisting of two parts: the anticipation (Erwartung) and conclusion
(Ausschluss). As a theory it has persisted as a basis for discussion even
though it was long ago found inapplicable to either the Greek Anthology or
Martial, and more closely defines epigram in the restricted sense of its
modern use. The commentaries show no awareness of a bi—partite struc-
ture of anticipation and conclusion. Instead the commentators often
analyze the epigrams’ arguments as comparisons, either a maiore, a minore,
ab aequali, or a contrario. As a simple example, Rader describes the epi-
gram on the arena of Domitian (Mart. 5.65) as a comparatio a minore to the
feats of Hercules.²³ These commentaries contain considerable evidence
to support the idea that, at least for Renaissance readers, the basis of
epigram, like the basis of wit, lies rather in comparison itself.²4

²⁴ Further support for this idea may be found in J. C. Scaliger’s discussion of
epigram in his Poetice (1561), book 3, cap. 126, 170.
