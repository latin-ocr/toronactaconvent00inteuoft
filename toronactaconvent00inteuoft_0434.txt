410 THE PROLOGUES OF COMOEDIA SACRA

point might seem more difficult to apply, but this does not prevent
Macropedius from relating his prodigal-son story Asotus to truth. Itis after
all a story of divine origin, another form of God’s creation, and truth is
ultimately identical with Christ himself:

sed auribus spectantium probam indimus
e veritatis ore lapsam fabulam.

quid fabulam? non fabulam, sed mysticam
e fonte pun'tatis haustam parabolam. . . .

(Asotus, prologue, lines 6-8)

“True'’ then means something more than “historically accurate''; rather it
covers the whole of the fourfold interpretation of scripture, embracing the
various allegorical senses as well as the literal one, and historical truth is
seen as the guarantee for a greater spiritual truth. The dramatised form of
such a “true'’ story then will equally be true on several levels.
Ciceronian truth has now been metamorphosed in something quite
different, so that for those who emphasize its importance‚ like Crocus and
Macropedius, it is able (in contrast with the criterion of usefulness) to
form a clear disjunction from classical models and an indisputable claim
to superiority. But it is clear none the less that the two criteria of Truth
and Usefulness were not felt to be in conflict. Truth after all is bound to
be useful, particularly if one concentrates on its allegorical applications,
and where it is used as a commendation it tends to be mentioned in close
connexion with moral utility. Yet for the historiari looking back on these
texts there is something almost emblematic about the confrontation of the
two ideas. In stressing Usefulness, authors are extending a classical com·
monplace, with reference to morality alone; in stressing Truth, they have
totally transformed Cicero’s dictum by introducing Christian revelation.
When describing their aims, no less than when working out the details of
their treatment, authors are caught between two value-systems imposing
often separate demands. In this light the cn’tics who appear in Sapidus’
prologue can be seen as the externalised form of internal pressure on the
dramatist; some people‚ he says, don't approve of using poetry—that is,
classical forms—to treat Christian themes, while others find sacred subjects
tedious. Can the apparently exclusive systems, each with its own ideals, be
reconciled? The whole endeavour of writing sacred comedy presupposes

dicam, sed verius.) James A. Parente, Jr. (Religious drama and the humanist tradition
[Leiden 1987] 43-44) compares Holonius, Lambertias A iiiv-iv, but also points out (p.
29) that such a distinction was not universal.
