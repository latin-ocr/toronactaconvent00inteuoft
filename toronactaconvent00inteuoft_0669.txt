I La danse macabre

The medieval Dance of Death¹ depicts an allegorical processional
dance of representatives of all human estates, from pope and

emperor down to beggar and baby, being lead to the grave by an emaciated
or skeletoned figure of Death. It found expression in late Medieval church-

yard murals, often accompanied by didactic verses with a noemento mori
moral. Such monuments were and many still are known all over Europe,

from Portugal to the Eastern BaJtic, and from Scandinavia to Italy and the

Balkans, as the existence of corresponding technical terms in the van‘ous
languages indicate: e.g., English dance osdeath, German mentam, Danish dade-
dans, Dutch dodendans, French dame mambre, Spanish dauza de la muerte. The
on'gin of the allegory seems to be shared between France and Germany.
