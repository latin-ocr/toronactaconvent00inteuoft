these works, accompanied by some unchan’table gloating over their
downfall [e.g., 216B—C and 248-49]. The Jews had not welcomed the
Messiah precisely because they had interpreted these psalms and other
prophecy too literally; the violence of Erasmus’s invective against the
Hebrew tmitors (with their pagan fellow-conspirators) may be explained by
his conviction that the truth had lain within their grasp but, in their
impiety, they had failed to embrace it; in their blindness, they had failed
to see it. It is also likely, though, that Erasmus’s scorn here for Judaism
and Pharisaism embodies a veiled attack on the Christian formalism which
so disgusted him: in these works it is only rarely [e.g., 290D-E1-and
caun'ously—that he alludes directly to such controversia] doctrinal ques-
tions. There is no place here for contemporary satire: even an apparently
slighu'ng reference to the death of Leo x—“his destination is uncertain”
[230F1-can be given a pious gloss: Erasmus will not arrogate to himself
God's prerogative ofjudgment.¹²

The positive function of these commentaries is thus to expound the
philosophia Christi. If Erasmus exhorts us to approach the portals of these
psalms with due awe and reverence [e.g., 171-72]‚ it is especially because
each in its different way is a prophecy of Christ, as the Fathers agree. That
is why they were of special interest to Erasmus among Old Testament
texts, since he viewed Christ as the true centre of all exegesisz¹³ “this
level of meaning is almost inexhaustible in the Psalms” [232A1. According
to Erasmus, Psalm l teaches that the remedy against temptation is to
meditate upon and imitate Christ, Psalm 2 describes the folly and passion
of Christ, Psalm 3 holds him up as the exemplar of perseverance, and
Psalm 4 foretells his words upon the cross. Erasmus's desire to be consis-
tent and comprehensive can lead to just the sort of logie-chopping which
he despised in his medieval predecessors (though his cause is doubtless
better): he admits, for example, that the verse [Ps 2:9] “You shall rule
them with an iron rod; you shall break them like a pot of clay'’ hardly sits
comfortably with the mildness and clemency of Christ; he is therefore
grateful for Hilary's helpful suggestion that a rod is only a sceptre, an
emblem of authority, like the praetor’s rod in ancient Rome (in a tight
spot, he will accept classical assistance), and that iron is used as a symbol
of durability rather than of harshness; he adds from his own stock the

¹² Cf. Ep. 1342, where Erasmus makes this very point, and Ep. 1248, a eulogy of
Leo. Erasmus's principal concern is to illustrate the ephemerality of earthly life.

with reverence.
