After Thura there were two simliar works in the Danish language. The
first of these, by Frederik Christian Schonau, is by far the most interesting
within the history of scholarship. It appeared in 1753.⁴ Like Thura,
Schonau has 100 women. In order to make room for twenty-three new
entn‘es, he must sacrifice some of Thura’s. His preface provides a thor-
ough introduction to the European gynaeceum genre.

The last gynaeceum also appeared in Danish, in 1793-1795.⁵ The author,
H. J. Birch, only provides nine new Danes, reducing the remaining corpus
drastically, not bemuse those who are rejected are not learned, but because
he is more interested in faithful wives than in unmarried female scholars.

From Sweden we have an academie dissertation on philosophical
women:Johan Esberg’s “Exercitium Academicum Mulieres Philosophantes
adumbrans,'’ defended in Upsala in 1699. “Mulieres philosophantes‘' is
not a gynaeceum‚ but a Latin treatise which takes it point of departure in
women who were interested in philosophy in Greco-Roman antiquity. No
Latin gynaecea are extant, but we know the title of a single work which
may have been written in Latin, parts of which seem to be preserved in an
article in “Stockholms Magasin for 1780” where 23 learned Swedish
women are listed.⁶

Influence from Southern Europe on the Scandinavian gynaecea is
extremely obvious. The prefaces to these works clearly show that the
authors are aware of the fact that they are writing within an existing
tradition. Competition also belongs to this tradition. The national pride
found in the Danish works is no less than that found in the remaining
European works. What counts is having as great a number of learned
women as possible.

The fact that we have relatively numerous and detailed works on the

to an unpublished work “Gynaeceum Sveciae Litteratum‚ eller Afhandling om larda
Swenska Fruentimmer” which may have been in Latin. The original manuscript is now
lost. Dr. Eva Haettner Olafsson and Mag. Valborg Lindgiirde have drawn my attention
to this article referring also to another Swedish Gynaeceum listing women from the

whole world: “Forsok til en Historia ὁίννει· Namnkunniga, Men i synnerhet Lirda
