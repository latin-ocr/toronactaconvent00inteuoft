The mix-up of languages‚ the dominant position of Latin, and the develop-
ment over half a century are documented in interesting detail by the
calendar notes of Peder Hegelund. He was born in Ribe in Jutland of a
rich and influential burgher family, went to the local Latin school, studied
in Leipzig and Wittenberg and held posts as a teacher, vicar and finally
bishop in his native town. He was also a poet and is nowadays best known
as the author of the first school drama in Danish, Susanna (Cph. 1578).
From his hand an almost unbroken series of annotated calendars from
1565 to 1613 has been preserved. Their main language is Latin, with an
occasional use of Greek, German, Danish, HebreW‚ and small drawings‚
e.g.‚ a pair of legs to illustrate that a letter has been sent off with a friend.
His notes concern both personal and public affairs. As a young student in
Germany he writes in some detail whenever news come in of events in the
Swedish-Danish war, but otherwise his notes are brief, telling of the
students’ lives, courses he attends‚ magisterial promotions‚ visits from
home, letters sent and received. Later in his life, he continues to comment
on his work, mentions visitors and letters, the texts he teaches, the dramas
he has his pupils perform. Thus he notes forJune 4th 1571 that his pupils
have performed Buchanan's Jephta. Events in his own life, his marriages
and children, bargainS, reading and publications are noted. There are
details of everyday life in Ribe, who has married whom, who has died,
who has been fighting, who has been condemned for witchcraft and, of
course, of disasters like fire, ssood and pestilence.¹⁶

During his student years Latin is almost universal, with Greek as the
second choice. German is used mostly for practical matters such as noting
purchases and doing accounts. The first note in Danish, and the only one

explains that since the author is less trained in writing German than Latin, his Latin
poem is longer and more precise than his German one (cf. note 8). L. Forster:

Wege der Forschung, vol. 353 (Darmstadt 1976): 424-43, has a survey (p. 432) of
reasons why poets preferred Latin to the vernaculars, including the explanation that
the ready-made models facilitated Latin composition.
