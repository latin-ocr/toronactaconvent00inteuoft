theologian Sancho Carranza put it summai-ily: “Scriptural studies do not
inquire into mode of expression, neatness, charm, or fluency of speech,
but rather into the content and meaning of speech.”⁷

Erasmus, in turn, insisted that philolog-ists could play a useful role in
scriptural studies. Indeed, “the whole business of translating the Holy
Scriptures is manifestly a grammarian’s function,” he wrote (CWE Ep.
182:144-45). In revising the Vulgate his aim had been to render the words
of the evangelists and apostles in simple, yet correct Latin: ut totus Novi
Testamenti sermo simplex quidem, sed tamen Latinus esset (LB VI fol. **3
verso). The question remained‚ however, whose standards of correctness
were to apply. Certainly they were not the standards of scholastic writers
whose style Erasmus frequently ridiculed. Nor was Erasmus ready to
embrace the other extreme and rewrite the New Testament in Ciceronian
style. Rather he trod a middle course between “Scotuses and the Ciceron-
ian apes.”⁸ To begin with, he was willing to take into consideration recepta
Christianis vocabula, “established Christian vocabulary” (CWE 28, p. 389).
To ignore the Christian tradition would be absurd, he wrote, and illustrat-
ed the point by recalling a sermon preached by a purist at the papal court
in Rome. Rigorously observing classical idiom, he had addressed the pope
asJupiter Optimus Maximus, likened the suffering of Christ to the death
of Socrates, his resurrection to the apotheosis of Roman emperors, and
his divine glory to the triumphs of Julius Caesar (ibidem, pp. 384-86).
Common sense dictated that the principle of aptum et decorum be observed
by a speaker. A speaker who applied incongruous pagan terms to Chris-
tian subjects was absurd, he concluded (ibidem, p. 447). Erasmus, then,
recognized the existence of a biblical idiom. Dialecticians, philosophers,
orators, grammarians, physicians, and mathematicians all used peculiares
voces, he wrote.⁹ It would be unfair to deny this privilege to theologians
and translators of scriptural texts. Among Christian “technical terms” he
listed words like sides, fidelis, benedictus, in nomine jesu, and gratia. ¹⁰ In his
Annotations on the New Testament he commented accordingly. Remarking‚
