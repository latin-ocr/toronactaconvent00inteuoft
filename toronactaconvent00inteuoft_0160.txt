140 THE EPISTOLAE AD EXERCITA'I'IONEM ACCOMMODATAE

Guarino, Poggio and Gasparino. In the De conscribendis he is less compli-
mentary since in the context he is emphasizing that only the best models
should be studied‚ and consequently Pliny and Cicero are to be preferred
to any other later writers who, despite their merits, must necessarily be
considered less worthy of imitation.⁵

Barzizza was known to his contemporaries as a true disciple of Cicero,
which indeed he was, but, as is clear from a cursory examination of the
style of the Epistolae ad exercitationem accommodatae, said to be his most
Ciceronian work, he cannot be ranked among the abject followers of
Ciceronianism. His reputation was based largely on these fictitious letters
set for the most part in Republican Rome. Τὴεγ immediately became

popular as school exercises and were circulated widely in manuscript, first
in Italy and then north of the Alps. The first known printed edition was
published byjean Lapierre (Iohannes de Lapide) at the Sorbonne in 1470,
which seems to be the first work to have been printed there. This was
followed by twenty more editions before 1505, all printed in the North:
Paris, Basel, Strasburg, Reutlingen, Louvain and Deventer.⁷ They were
later included in the edition of Barzizza’s works published by Cardinal
Giuseppe Alessandro Furietti in 1723 in homage to his fellow Bergam-
asque, reprinted in Bologna in 1969. 1 cite from this edition.⁸

There has been no thorough study of this important experiment in the
history of epistolography‚ which signalled a breaking away from the arid
formalism of the dictamen tradition to the more eloquent models of
Cicero’s correspondence. After Petrarch's momentous discovery of the
letters to Atticus, Quintus and Brutus in 1345 and Salutati's recovery

⁶ In his inaugural lecture after assuming the chair of rhetoric left vacant by
Barzizza, Antonio da Rho had this to say of his predecessor: “Gasparinum Per-
gamensem, qui, ut aiunt, Ciceronem ipsum ita menti, ita memoriae commendarat, ut

vel exstinctum ipse ex integro illum suscitare et in lucem afferre quidem potuisset.”

1928), vol. 3, columns 552-58. It is thought that the book was not printed in Italy in
the fifteenth century because its inculcating of the principles of a civic sense was
politically dangerous. Cf. Gilles Gerard Meersseman, “11 De arte epistolandi di G. De
Veris,'’ Italia medioeoale e umanistica 15 (1972): 215.
