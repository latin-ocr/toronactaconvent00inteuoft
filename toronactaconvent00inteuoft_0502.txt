478 JOHANNES MURMELLIUS’ SCOPARIUS

ing, among others, Lorenzo Valla, Niccolo Perotti, Ermolao Barbam,
Guillaume Bude, and Erasmus. A number of Greek lexicons are likewise
suggested, including specialized dictionaries for the Attic dialect. In
another chapter—the longest and probably the most important in the
Scoparius—Murmellius recommended the best humanistic commentaries
written for sacred and especially profane literary works (62). This checklist
has also been summarized by Reichling and discussed by Nauwelaerts.²⁶
In addition to the numerous learned commentaries on the familiar Greek
and Latin classics, Murmellius suggested that his own comments be
consulted for Boethius' De philosophiae consolatione. He even noted several
recent commentaries for the modern authors Petrarch‚ Sabellico, Polizia-
no, Mantuanus, Giovanni Pico, and Lefevre d'Etaples.

In the remaining selections, Murmellius basically returned to his theme
of grammatical abuse. He cited examples of corrupt grammar, and their
correction, in Vergil (63), Cicero (72), and several other classical authors,
as well as particular Latin phrases: “en umquam'' (65), “insubidus'' (68),
“popa'' (71), and “labarum’' (73). Again, it was an arrogance bred of
“Aristotelian instruction'' (i.e., scholasticism) that had caused the enemies
of the studia humanitatis to write and speak such debased language (66).
He agreed with Raphael Regius (75), as well as Bude (76, 78), Francesco
Filelfo (79), and Georgius Valla (80-82), that unlearned “grammatici,'’
“leguei,” and “philosophastri'’ were the major culpn'ts. But chief among
the offenders were the lawyers of his own time, who had substituted a
“Gothica lingua'' for the eloquent style of the ancient jurists (77). This had
resulted in a “barbarian‘’ vocabulary, whereby lawyers now say “guerra’'
for “bello,'' “causus legis‘' for “specie,” “vasallus’' for “cliente‚’' and so on
(84). He pointed out that such legal practices had been denounced and
satirized by several humanists‚ including More in his Utopia and Erasmus
in The Praise osFolly (83).²⁷

Murmellius next directed his ridicule towards the kinfolk of ignorant
lawyers, the sophists and dialecticians. Aristotle himself is cited as a major
authority against the sophists (86). Besides a quotation from Ecclesiasticus,
Murmellius drew upon passages from the early Christian fathers, where
the false wisdom of sophists and logicians is denounced: in Seneca,
