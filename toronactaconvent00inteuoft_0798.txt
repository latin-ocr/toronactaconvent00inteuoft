772 ERASMUS’S PRECATIONES

passion are recounted in a very realistic manner describing, for example,
the bitter tears, the wounds, and the “thousand streams of red blood
flowing from all over the body.’'²⁰

The two prayers to Mary just mentioned were written, together with a
prayer to jesus, some time before the year 1500. They are the earliest
prayers of Erasmus we know of. On a number of occasions Erasmus
informs us that he wrote these prayers at the request of Anna van Veere
and in deference to the wishes of Jacob Batt. In a letter to the young
Adolf van Veere that precedes the Lucubratiunculae he says he made the
prayers to suit Adolf' s tender age.²¹ In a letter to John Colet of Decem-
ber 1504, Erasmus says that he wrote the Euchiridion (that made up part
of the Lucubratiunculae) “to counteract the error of those who make
religion in general consist in rituals. . . .’' He creates the impression that
the Enchiridion is the only part of the Lucubratiunculae that has his full
support, saying: “as for all the rest, 1 wrote them almost against the grain,
especially the Paean and the Obsecratio.''²² This explicit mention of the
two prayers to Mary, by the way, was added only in 1521.²³ In 1523, in
the famous letter to Botzheim containing the catalogue of his writings
(complemented in 1524), Erasmus reiterates his reservations with regard
to the prayers to Mary, The prayer to JesuS‚ on the other hand, he had
written, he sayS‚ “magis ex animo me0,'' more from the heart.²⁴

Obviously‚ then, the style of Erasmus's Paean and Obsecratio greatly
differs from that of his other prayers. This is true of their contents as well.
Erasmus never rejected the moderate worship of Mary,²⁵ but that is not
what we find in these prayers. Not only is the Holy Virgin exuberantly
praised here, she is also invoked as the “mater misericordiae,’‘ who can
mitigate the wrath of her son, that severe judge.²⁶ Elsewhere, however,
Erasmus teaches that sinners facing the severe justice of God or Christ
must appeal to the mercy of the Father or the Son himself.²⁷
