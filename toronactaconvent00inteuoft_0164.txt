144 THE EPISTOLAE AD EXERCITATIONEM ACCOMMODATAE

Brutus, which he had discovered in the cathedral of Lodi in 1421.ιο Be-
fore this discovery the first two works were known only in a mutilated ver-
sion, and indeed it was Barzizza who had attempted to fill in many of the
lacunae. Guarino wrote of him that it was through his efforts that Cicero
was loved and read in all the Italian schools: “cuius ductu et auspiciis
Cicero amatur, legitur et per Italorum gymnasia summa curn gloria voli-
tat.’'¹¹ Yet, as Sabbadini long ago pointed out,¹² he was not always
Ciceronian either in vocabulary or syntax. In his private letters, in particu-
lar, he ignores grammatical canons and achieves a greater naturalness of
style. In the Exercitationes he is more formal, since they were meant as
models, but it must be emphasized that the style of these letters is a far
cry from that of Cicero’s. His was a spontaneous, elegant yet colloquial
language, difficult to emulate by any other writer of Latin. As Erasmus
remarked in his De conscribendis epistolis, you may write on the spur of the
moment if you wish, write whatever comes to your head (quidquid in
buccam venerit, a well-known phrase of Cicero’s), as long as it is the way
Cicero wrote to Atticus.¹³ Cicero employs many more diminutives used
in everyday language like perbelle, misellus, pulchellus, mi vetule, meliuscule,
rumusculi, even such coinages as subturpicula. He often dispenses with the
more formal rhythms of the clausulae, especially in his letters to Atticus
and prefers to write more Romano, in a good straightforward language
without artifice, as he noted in a letter to Julius Caesar, apologizing that
he was putidusculi, “in rather poor taste,'' in that letter, since he was intent
on recommending his friend Trebatius (Adsam. 7.5.3).

The letters composed by Barzizza resemble the more formal type of
letter used by Cicero in his commendaticiae (Ad fam. 13), and in certain
carefully written letters, as that to Cato, in which he seeks his support in
the Senate for a supplicatio honoring his victory over the Parthians during
his governorship of Cilicia (Ad sam. 15.4), the first letter to his brother
Quintus, which was more of an open letter meant for a wider audience, or
the very ornate letter to Lucceius (Ad fam. 5.12) valde bella, as Cicero
himself calls it (Ad Att. 4.6.4).

In matters of vocabulary, the Exercitationes certainly exhibit a generally
