260 CREATING HUMANIST MYTHS

But did this image correspond to reality? Were the humanists indeed such
a powerful block, as Hutten suggests here, and as most critics believe they
were at that time? They were not and Overfield has convincingly demon-
strated this in his study. It is true that the support for Reuchlin was
widespread but it was not by any means unanimous. Prominent humanists
such as Jakob Wimpfeling, Sebastian Brant, Uln'ch Zasius, Johannes
Aesticampianus, and Jakob Locher never wrote a single line on behalf of
the embattled scholar.¹6 Others, like Mutianus, had their strong reserva-
tions, and Erasmus, as always, hedged and kept his options open.¹⁷ In
other words, the notion of a monolithic fraternity of humanists all rushing
to support Reuchlin is, if not a fiction, at least a questionable claim. Just
as a military leader tends to exaggerate the size of his troops to intimidate
the enemy, so Hutten magnifies the size and unity of the humanist forces.
That he presents the humanists‚ whose intellectual leadership was based
on the power of the word and not physical superiority, as such a physically
abusive group, must be ascribed to his heritage as a knight.¹⁸ Again
Hutten was essentially creating a myth of the power, influence and
strength of a movement that really did not exist.

It would be foolish to deny the tensions that existed between humanism
and scholasticism on the eve of the Reformation. What this paper wanted
to suggest, however, was that the notion of a unified and cohesive human-
ist movement seems to have been, to a large extent the creation of the
humanists themselves and that Ulrich von Hutten played a very important
role in that mythmaking. Because the humanists‚ compared to their
counterparts, were so articulate and ostensibly modern, historians have
tended to accept their statements at face value, even when these were cast
in the satirical mode, as in the case of the Epistolae obscurorum virorum.
None of the charm, wit and sublime irony of this satire would be lost,
however, if we start viewing it as what it was meant to be: a not too subtle
piece of propaganda with its own myths about opponents and adherents
of the humanist movement.

¹⁸ As we know from his biography, he himself was not averse to occasionally
resorting to violence: in viterbo, for instance, he had stabbed one Frenchman in a
quarrel.
