Science versus Secular Lifi’:
A Central Theme in the Latin Poems

os Tycho Brahe

PETER ZEEBERG

The astronomer Tycho Brahe is without doubt the best known

character of the Danish renaissance. His international fame is based,
not on any single great discovery—like, e.g.‚ Kepler’s discovery of the laws
of movement in our solar system-but on his being the founder of modern
observational astronomy. He was in fact the first one to engage in regular,
systematic observation of the stars, and the data he compiled over more
than twenty years became the material upon which were based the scientif-
ic advances of the following century-and especially Kepler’s.

My concern here, though, is not astronomy but his Latin poeny, which in
my view is interesting not only for its literary value, but also as a source of
knowledge as to his position in the cultural life of Denmark at the time, and
as to the atmosphere in which research was carried on at his oestle Uraniborg.

But first some biographical facts.¹
