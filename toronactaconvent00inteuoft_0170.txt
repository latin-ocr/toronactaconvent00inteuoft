150 ERASMUS' OPUS DE CONSCRIBENDIS EPISTOLIS

treats the etiquette of epistolary formulas, especially of salutation and
valediction(ASD1-2z266-300). In D, he classifies letters according to their
varied functions and offers both rules and examples for the argument and
organization of his types (ASD 1—21301-579). Thus Erasmus provides a
complete textbook of epistolary rhetoric, coven‘ng inventio and dispositio
(D) and elocutio (A, C) and incorporating an instructor's manual (B). He
omits only the two divisions of rhetoric, actio and memoria, inapplicable to
a written genre.

If we assume that the first draft of the treatise, composed for Robert
Fisher in 1498, is lost, the earliest version extant seems to be the Libellus
de conscribendis epistolis (composed 1499), a draft of Section D of the
finished treatise. Erasmus will later replace its brief introductory remarks
on style with Sections A-C of the Opus. The Libellus begins with the
classical distinction between the intimate, conversational style of the letter
(sermo) and the public, declamatory style of the oration (contentio). Erasmus
inveighs against medieval conventions of salutation and encourages
imitation of classical formulas, but he accepts innovation as long as the
writer avoids barbarism and parasitic flattery. Borrowing from Francesco
Negro’s opusculum scribendi epistolas (Venice: H. Lichtenstein, 1488) a
classification of letters as “mixed'’ and “unmixed,'' he nevertheless takes
his Quattrocento predecessor to task for insisting that every letter include
an introduction. Erasmus then further classifies “unmixed” letters as de-
liberative, demonstrative, and judicial, dividing these again into species, as
in the Opus. Letters that do not fall into these causae orationis he labels
“extraordinary.'' He describes the topics the writer will use to develop
each species of argument, their order, and the best means of making the
argument persuasive. For each species he provides illustrations.

The author of the Libellus has completely assimilated Italian humanism.
He feels free to criticize Quattrocento handbooks of letter-writing, but he
writes in the tradition they established, an uneasy synthesis between
medieval art (ars dictaminis) and classica} imitation.⁸ The ars dictaminis
adapted rhetoric to written composition, especially letter-writing. The
letter, like the oration, was divided into parts, usually five: salutatio,
exordium, narratio, petitio, conclusio. Its style was formal, its purpose persua—
