582 HUMANIST POETRY AND ITS CLASSICAL MODELS

ones we usually find involved in the literary projects of the Imperial
court.³ No fewer than eight of the twenty-one contributors had by the
time of the publication been crowned poet laureate by Maximilian.⁴

At first glance there seems to be little which distinguishes our collection
from countless similar products of the early sixteenth century. Extravagant
praise, formulated in the most commonplace phrases, can be found over and
over again in the poetry of that age, and hardly any of the poems published
is outstanding as a poetical achievement. The CBH represent the average
quality of this type of poetica] productiori at Maximilian's court. Nevertheless
our collection occupies a special place in the history of German humanist
literature. As it was printed only a few months before Maximilian's death, it

represents a last synthesis of the literary aspirations of the Imperial court,
especially since Luther’s theses had been published the year before and soon
were to change the German political and literary scene entirely.

cicus Ι l Vates plectra seret (b2v, vv, 42 f.) alludes to Celtis (see n. 26 below), it, too,
would predate Celtis’ death in 1508 and presumably belong to the years 1504-1506,
when Bartolini was in Germany (for biographical details see Fiissel, pp. 36-37).
Gadius' marriage poem (el¹-e3‘) may be dated to 1511, Celtis’ Carnorum preses quod
sactus es (ἀφ-(Ἂν) and other poems can be referred to the time of Holzel's
appointment in Carinthia. Further poems dated by Jan-Dirk Miiller, Gedechlnus:
Literatur und Hosgesellschafl um Maximilian I, Forschungen zur Geschichte der alteren
deutschen Literatur, 2 (Miinchen¹ 1982) 261, 303 n. 67, and 373 n. 47.

³ We catch a glimpse of their daily life in a letter by 1. Spiegel to Erasmus of 31
Aug. 1518, written in Augsburg (Allen, no. 863), in which he writes about an oration
delivered by Erasmus Vitellius at the diet on Aug. 22: Aderant enim viri non pauci, tum
exquisite docti tum in iudicando naris emunctissime, Antistes Tergestinus [=Bonomus],
Peutingerus, fluximus, Barfflolinus, Spalatinus, et Stabius ille in nullo doctrine genere non
versatus . . . An earlier production similar to ours, but on a smaller scale, had been the
Episodia sodalitatis Danubianae ad Conradum Cellen, dum a Norico gymnasio ad Viennam
Pannoniae concesserat, 18 short poems printed in Vienna around 1497; among the
contibutors we find Cuspinianus, stabius, Ulsenius, and the duo Bonomi. The poems
are published in Kurt Adel, ed., Conrodi Celtis quae Vindobonae prelo subicienda miravit
opuscula (Leipzig, 1966), 6-11.

⁴ Celtis (1487), Cuspinianus (1493), Bebel (1501), Stabius (1502s 3 by Celtis),
Sibutus (1505), Sbrulius (1513), Ursinus (1517), Bartholini (1517). A lacuna may be the
absence of another poet laureate: Vadian (crowned in 1514). On May lst, he was still
in Vienna, in Sept. 1518 he had been in St. Gallen for some time (cf. his dedicatory
letter to Konrad Grebel: Conradin Bonorand and Heinz Haffter, eds„ Die Dedika·
tionsepisteln von und an Vadian, Vadian-Studien, Untersuchungen und Texte. Heraus·
gegeben vom Historischen Verein des Kantons St. Gallen, ll [St. Gallen, 1983]‚ p. 131
no. 303 Bernhard Min, Vadian als Ant, Vadian-Studien, 6 [St. Gallen, 19591, 42). The
most probable reason for his absence is that he simply was not acquainted very well

with Holzel (cf. Conradin Bonorand, Vadians Weg vom Humanismus zur Reformation und
seine Vorcrage iiber die Apostelgeschichte 1523, VadianStudien, 7 [St. Gallen, 19621, 56.
