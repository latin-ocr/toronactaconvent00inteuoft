42 LATIN IN 16TH-CENTURY DANISH CULTURE

A Nobleman’s Epitaph

The inscription in figure l commemorates one of the most prominent
Danish noblemen of the time‚Jorgen Rosenkrantz. He was for decades a
member of the King's Council, and when in 1588 Frederic II died, leaving
an heir who was still a minor, Jorgen Rosenkrantz became one of the four
members of the regency. At his own death in 1596 he was the most
powerful man in the country. The poem was probably composed almost
twenty years earlier. It is painted on a wooden board and hangs on the
wall of a chapel in the church of Hornslet in Jutland. It is written in two
columns with Roman letters for the Latin version and Gothic letters for
the Danish. The poem is encircled by sixteen coats of arms belonging to
Jorgen Rosenkrantz’ ancestors. At the bottom there is a black area framed
by two figures, Pietas and Justitia.
