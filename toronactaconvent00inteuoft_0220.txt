196 THE POL1T1cs or IRENICISM

the text the Commentatio offers an appropriation of the biblical encounter
which the reader must seize into his personal circumstances. But what
marks this book and separates it from any Erasmian concept of decorum
is its syncretising vocabulary. It is this which makes it so obviously a
product of its time and place, adopting in its extended discourse the
features already familiar in the Lyonnais poets and defended by Dolet in
the Erasmianus: “what was elegant and beautiful in Cicero’s day is still
beautiful. Itis absurd to think of painting God asJove, but the painter will
use the same colours whether he paints Jove or Christ.''¹⁶

As an illustration of Wilson's syncretistic use of such colores we can take
two consecutive verses which provide a direct encounter between the
biblical and the classical:

Si ascendero in coelum, tu illic es: si ad inferos demigrem, ades. Si
sumptis diliculo pennis ad extremum usque mare deferar, manus
tua est, quae et ducit, et detinet.

Tu unus ille hominumque deumque pater, summus Iupiter, cuius
numine omnia sunt plena. Tu spiritus, qui coelum, terram, cam-
posque liquentes intus alit. Tu mens illa, quae per magni huius
corporis artus infusa totam molem agitat.¹⁷

The first verse is a straight rendering of that most awesome of Psalms,
13928-10. (“1f1 ascend up into heaven, thou art there; ifI make my bed
in hell, behold thou art there. If 1 take the wings of the morning and dwell
in the uttermost parts of the sea: even there shall thy hand lead me, and
thy right hand shall hold me.'') Then, in the second verse, this cosmic
sense of God is presented in classical form, that of “summus Jupiter'’

whose power is expressed in an adaptation of Anchises’ words in the
Aeneid 6.724-27,

Principio coelum, ac terras, camposque liquentes,
Lucentemque globum Lunae, Titaniaque astra
Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus.
Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.

Now, first. The sky and the lands, the watery plains, the moon’s gleam-
