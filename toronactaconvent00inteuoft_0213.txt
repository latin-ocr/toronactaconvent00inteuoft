and the Politics of Irenicism

DOMINIC BAKER-SMITH

acopo Sadoleto died in Rome on 18 October, 1547. The ageing
cardinal had been failing for some months, but shortly before his
death it appears that he was well enough to receive a visitor, a litte‘mteur
with reformist sympathies. Since this visitor, Orgetorix Sphinter, has not
left a fiery trail across history it is difficult to discover much about him: he
may have been Hungarian by birth, he was certainly familiar with Aonio
Paleario (himself a figure of marked ambivalence in matters of religious
loyalty), and he had some dealings with the important Basle printer
Johannes Oporinus.¹ It was Oporinus, an irenical entrepreneur who
handled publications from both sides of the religious divide which was still
far from sharply defined, that printed a collection of Latin poems on
religious themes under the title Pii, graves, atque elegantes poetae aliquot. It
is undated but certainly from the period 1548-1550, and it contains a
prefatory letter addressed by Sphinter to Oporinus in which he describes
his recent meeting with Sadoleto.² In a sense Sadoleto is given credit for
the concept behind the volume.
According to Sphinter the old man had lamented the way in which

Oporinus and his contacts see Peter G. Bietenholz, Basle and France in the Sixteenth
Cemmy (Geneva, 1971).

² The fact that Sphinter's letter is addressed “Romae” suggests that he wrote it
soon after the meeting with Sadoleto since he is reported in Strasbourg by January
1548 (Manu, Paleario, 2:182); the reference to “Helvetiis nostris” sounds odd from an
Hungarian, though it may be a courtesy to Oporinus.
