l42 THE EPISTOLAE AD EXERCITATIONEM ACCOMMODATAE

saith even in the face of adverse criticism directed at the corespondent in
his absence. Concerning this aspect of friendship Barzizza inserts a dictum
in one of his letters, which may well be of his own composition, that it is
the mark of a good man that he does not easily believe of another what he
himself would not have admitted in his own conduct, “Maxime enim puto
boni hominis esse non facile de alio credere quod ipse non admisisset’'
(Furietti, p. 231). In matters of friendship it is important not to emphasize
unduly one's own services, This is well illustrated in one exchange, in
which the first writer protests that there was never any personal advantage
that he would not neglect in deference to his friend's good or any incon-
venience that he would not undergo in order to be of benefit to his
friend. His respondent chides him for protesting too much and once again
Barzizza provides a fitting comment, that nothing is less characteristic of
those who love than that they should remember their own good offices
but forget those of another (“nihil enim mihi videtur minus amantium
esse quarn sui officii meminisse et alieni oblivisci.’' Furietti, p. 243). In all
of these discussions, however, friendship is always made subordinate to
right conduct, honestum. One must be prepared to prosecute even a
friend’s friend when necessary.

Of interest are samples of admonitory letters sent from concerned
friends or relatives to students who have slackened in their studies. Such
examples were later imitated by Carolus Virulus in his very popular
Epistolarum formulae. In one letter the admonisher in rather severe lan-
guage warns his correspondent that if he continues in the direction he has
now taken (perseveraveris pergere, Furietti, p. 292, is the alliterative phrase
used) all his friends will cease to look after his interests, and he will return
to his city in great disgrace. The answer is a lively defense of student
escapadeS‚ in which the writer says he is no different from others; “nihil
facio praeter morem aliorum‘' (Furietti, p. 293). He pleads for more
temperate chastisement while acknowledging that it was paternal. His last
sentence is a good show of bravado: “me talem efficiam, cui inimici mei
invideant et amici congratulentur.''

Other letters are concerned with public events, the internal strife of the
republic, troubles in the East‚ preparations for war, the conduct of military
campaigns. Most of these events are represented against the implicit
background of ancient Rome, but in one exchange the scene is suddenly
transferred to the contemporary scene in Northern Italy, the political
fortunes of Cremona, Brescia, and Bergamo (Furietti, p. 263). Other
letters may contain allusions to contemporary events also, such as one that
tells of a prince who had formerly suppressed liberty by force of arms but
now openly shared his powers with the common people (Furietti, p. 267).
