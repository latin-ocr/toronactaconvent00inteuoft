consists of a few trunks‚ of a thickness of one and one half spans, twisted‚
and protected with a testaceous coagulum. The uneven and fragile branch-
es produce furcula which are leafy, two cubits and opposite at long
intervals. Itis covered with a bark that is hard, ash-colored, and somewhat
wooly in furcula. Τὴε wood is hard and solid, catches fire with difficulty
but retains it stubbornly; as it burns, however, the wood does not dissolve
into coals but into ashes. The plant bears single leaves alternately oppo-
site, attached with thick leafstalks weakening into yellow, flat, oblong,
ending in a blunt tip, figid, pinguid, fragile, with an unbroken circumfer-
ence, an inner surface which is green and shiny, an outer surface that is
incanous and slightly pubescent, with a salty taste‚ which may result from
the sap or from the salty surface which the sea had so often flooded. It
puts forth rather sparse flowers on the outermost extremities of the
furcula. The flowers are pale yellOW, imperfect for the most part, divided
into four (sometimes five) labella which expand and bend backwards
within the orb of a pea, are carnous and shapeless. The flowers have a
very short style within and four pointed stamens. The amygdaline fruit
follows the ssower. The fruit has a grass-green pericarp, which through
ripening is somewhat tough‚ and a stone inside that adheres firmly. Its
kernel is divided into two parts and is insipid. Amygdalus marina has
economic uses: as flrewood, of course, and foliage to feed carneis. For this
reason, boats, launched with the outgoing tide, go forth in the cool of the
night to thickets (with which the island of Kismis abounds) and with the
incoming tide they return laden with cut sterns. These they gather in
bundles and offer for sale on the shore. 1 have found the same tree, in
sufficient abundance, on the marshy shore of India under the Malayan
name of Saga.
