570 JEAN DE PINS

jean de Pins' initial renown (founded essentially on two minor publica·
tions he had made during his early years of study in Italy³) was soon to be
surpassed, however, as he went on to become one of the most respected
statesmen and clergy members of his time. He was an influential senator
in two French Parliaments (Toulouse⁴ and Milan), French ambassador to
Venice (1516- 1520) and to Rome (1520- 1522), before his election as
bishop of Rieux (1523), where he played an important r61e in ecclesiasti-
cal, political and cultura] affairs until his death in 1537. Two useful
biographies have been written about him. One, by Ikonard charron,
appeared in 1748.⁵ It is admittedly encomiastic in nature and contains
general biographical information followed by an important selection of his
political correspondence in French. Another genealogically oriented study
by Gentil Cormary was published in 1933? correcting some of the minor
errors of his predecessor. Yet it is interesting to note that neither of these
authors had ever been able to consult an important manuscript collection
ofJean de Pins’ Latin correspondence. They admit having learned of its
existence, but were, despite their laudable efforts, unable to discover its
location.⁷ Beyond what could be learned through independent sources,
such as dedications of scholarly works, the published correspondence of
other humanists‚ de Pins' own scholarly publications or archival docu-
ments, they knew but little of his early years of formation (notably about
his studies in Italy), and less still of the humanist circles that had formed
around him, or to which he had adhered. His relations with Erasmus of

³ Besides contributions to an edition of Codrus Urceus’ Orationes (Bologna, 1502),
de Pins published two other works during his years of study in Italy: a Philippi Beroaldi
Bononiensis vita (Bol a, per Benedictum Hectoreum, 1505), containing a prefatory
epistle addressed to {nenne Poncher, bishop of Paris, and a Divae Gathar-inae Senensis
vita, published together with a reprint of Vita Philippi Beroaldi (Bologna, 1505),
dedicated to Louis d’ Amboise, bishop of Albi. Subsequent publications are his Divi
Rochi Narbonnensis vita (Venice, 1516); an Allobrogicae narrationis liber (Venice, 1516),
addressed to Guillaume and Antoine Du Prat, sons of chancellor Antoine Du Prat3 and
a now rare posthumous edition of his De vita aulica, Toulouse: ex typographia Iacobi

Columbei [1540] (cf. Bibliotheca Bibliographica Aureliana, vol. 58, Baden-Baden,
