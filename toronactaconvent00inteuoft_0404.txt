380 ERASMUS'S SUSPICIONS OF ALEANDER

bered as the former patron of Aldus⁵⁷ and the Roman acquaintance of
the Liegian bishop Erard de la Marck who had welcomed Aleander in
Rome after his return from Liege in 1516.⁵⁸ And, as we have seen, Eras-
mus saw one more proof of his convictions in the circulation of the
pamphlet Racha, which he considered to be Aleander’s personal, direct
contribution to the campaign. He maintained his opinion unchanged
throughout the controversy with Pio, even when the latter showed no
signs of recognition at Erasmus's allusion to Aleander with the indication
“diplomatophorus,” as mentioned above.

It has already been said that right from the beginning Erasmus connect—
ed Pio’s activities with the person of Aleander. In Pio's last work, the
Twenty-three Books‚ Erasmus assumed not only Aleander‘s instigation‚ but
also his direct assistance in collecting the blameworthy texts: “Ni me fallit
animi coniectura, Aleander huic et addit animum et loca suppeditat.”⁵⁹
According to a letter to Pirckheimer, it was said that Aleander, now living
in Venice, precisely for this reason subjected all the works of Erasmus to
a close investigation.⁶⁰

Now the question is whether Erasmus's suspicions as to the close
collaboration between Pio and Aleander and particularly as to the latter’s
share in the Twmtythree Books were right. Here, a quiet and late, but
confident and plain negation from Aleander stands against Erasmus’s
repeated and resentful assertion. Aleander's negation sounds rather
sincere and I think that he this time men'ts our credit. It is connected with
the negation of the authorship of a recently published Gratia, a reaction to
Erasmus’s Ciceronianus. In a letter, now lost, Erasmus accused Aleander of
hiding behind the author’s name, Julius Caesar Scaliger.⁶¹

On 1 April 1532 Aleander sent Erasmus his answer in two letters.
The first opens with Pio’s name: “Alberto Pio I have met no more than
three or four times in the past decade and your cause was not the subject
of our talks. As far as Ι know, 1 did not wn'te him for seven years and 1
certainly have not seen him the past five years.” Aleander goes on to

⁵⁷ In his Epistola paraenetica (above n. 17, doc. B) Pio pointed to the possibility that
he might have met with Erasmus at Aldus's in Venice in 1508.
