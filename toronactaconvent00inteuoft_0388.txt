364 ERASMUS’S EARLY PSALM COMMENTARIES

exposition of the First Psalm [182E] he complains about certain theolo-
gians “with unwashed hands and feet’' who, when they get their dirty
hands on holy scripture, will always force it, however reluctant and unwill-
ing it may be, into the prescribed mould. Erasmus’s own flexible twofold
division, into literal and concealed meaning, removes the obligation to
find all four senses in any given passage.

Of these two, Erasmus usually has little time for the literal or historical
sense; he reminds us of Paul's dictum about the “letter which kills'‘ [2
Cor. 3:⁶3. cf. 220D] and dismisses the “contentious and unprofitable
speculations‘' [243D] of the rabbis, who all disagree with one another
about the historical details:

I do not disapprove entirely of looking at what the Hebrew commen-
tators have to say, especially the older ones, but 1 do not think that
they have very much to offer, seeing that their commentaries are
pretty much stuffed with vapourings and old wives' tales—not to
mention their desire to discredit our interpretations, and their hatred

of Christ. [2020]

So Erasmus concentrates on the concealed meaning. In the De copia, he
identified no less than five loose categories which reflect but do not
coincide with the traditional scheme of exegesis:

Whenever we are endeavouring to turn men towards piety or away
from wickedness, we shall find very useful anecdotes drawn from the
Old or the New Testament. The hidden meaning of these can be
variously handled; it can be explained in terms of human life, or of
the body of the Church joined and connected to Christ the head, or
of the fellowship of heaven, or of those early days when the faith was

newborn‚ or of our own times. [CWE 24, 635]

Or—almost anythingl In fact, Erasmus usually has little to say on the most
abstract of these categorieS, the anagogic or eschatological: on Psalms l
and 2, for example, he says no more than a few words on their possible
application to the Day ofJudgment [196C-D and 225EJ. He expounds the
First Psalm “Blessed the man'' l Beatus vir “above all according to the
tropologica} sense‚'' he says;⁵ this preoccupation with ethics reflects the
period in which the exposition was written, as it often echoes the long
adages published in the same year, 1515, and above all the Institutio

to, 1969-[CWE])‚ 27:134 and the Ecclesiastes in LB 5 1035A.
⁵ “quta tropologiam potissimum”; this is part of the subtitle in the early editions.
