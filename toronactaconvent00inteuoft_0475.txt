It is then further necessary to see how far the text of Catullus was
known in the fourteenth century and how it was received. For this pur·
pose 1 checked the manuscript tradition and all the instances where
Catullus is mentioned or quoted in texts of that century. The result was
the observation that the text of Catullus was distributed very slowly and
that a very small number of humanists in northern and middle Italy came
to know it. They studied this text and quoted sometimes passages from it
for moralistic, anfiquarian, philological or, in case of c. 16 with its distinc-
tion between the vita and the verses of a poet, for learned poetic reasons.
Τὴε various metres were observed and defined, some ioci appreciated.
Petrarch once used the term nugae as a formula of modesty for his own
writingS. But nobody in the whole century tried to write poems in Catullan
style. Catullus was one of the rediscovered ancient authors and as such
important, but he was not among the most favorite authors of anybody; he
stood, so to speak, in the second rOW. His rediscovery had not yet lead to
his renaissance.

In the first half of the fifteenth century, his text was considerably wider
distributed. The first warnings against reading Catullus in school appear.
In this time Latin poetry in Catullan style began. In modern literature
Antonio Beccadelli, called Panormita (1394-1471), is often named as a
prominent imitator of Catullus. 1 checked his poem collection Hermaphro-
ditus from 1425 and the letters of humanists related to it and found that
Panormita did not yet imitate the style of Catullus, but that he was most
important in preparing the way for the Catullus-imitations of Pontano.
Panormita mentions Catullus at the head of a list of ancient authors who,
as he says, all wrote poems full of lascivia, and he defends his own ob-
scene elegiacs with the Catullan distinction of the castus et pius poeta and
the versus molliculi et parum pudici. Catullus and other ancient poets
protect and legitimize his audaciously obscene and sexually on‘ented
poetry. But if you check these poems, only very few borrowings from
Catullus are to be found. They restrict themselves on the use of the verbs
pedicare and irrumare, on some obscene motives from c. 97 and on the tag
of the thousand kisses. Panormita never tried to imitate the Catullan style
or the typical hendecasyllabics. Martial and the Carmina Priapea were his
more prominent models, but he pointed to Catullus as a patron of frivo-
lous poetry.

Before Pontano could follow this hint, Cristoforo Landino (1424-1504)
came to Catullus by another way in Florence. He wrote a poem collection
titled Xandra in 1443s4. It contains mainly elegies, but also two hendeca-
syllabic poems and three Sapphic odes. On the whole a cycle of love
poems, it is primarily oriented on Propertius. But Landino mentions also
