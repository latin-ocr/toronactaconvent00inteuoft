Dolet of militant atheism.¹² By 1538, denunciations of Dolet’s atheism
come thick and fast-and from former friends.¹³

This is the background to epigrams on Dolet published by his close
friend and fellow-epigrammatistJoannes Vulteius. Vulteius published some
thirty epigrams in praise of Dolet in 1536 and 1537. In 1538, in poems
clearly alluding to Dolet though not by name, he accuses him of being a
covert atheist—and says he took singularly little trouble to conceal his
views.¹⁴ Vulteius's In quendam imligiosum Luciani sectatorem fits absolutely
the portrait given in the Cymbalum mundi. Nor was Vulteius the only
epigrammatist to castigate Dolet for atheist views. The reason why Vulteius
and others publicly distanced themselves was that Dolet’s reputation made
him a dangerous man to know. Fn'endship with radical thinkers aroused
suspicion: at least one humanist was questioned by the Inquisition for his
friendship with Dolet.¹⁵ Dolet was an especially dangerous friend for
those who had themselves come under suspicion for their religion, as
many of Dolet’s friends had.

Was Dolet really an atheist? Might one argue that his “real'' position is
better represented by his work in publishing edifying biblica] books?
Witnesses like Odonus, Des Periers and Vulteius, who all knew Dolet,
leave little or no room for such speculation. Their presentation of Dolet

“Pierre de Vingle, l'imprimeur de Farel,'' in G. Berthoud et aL, Aspects de la propagande
religieuse (Geneve, 1957), 74.

¹² 1 accept the traditional attribution of the Cymbalum mundi to Des Periers: see L.
Sozzi, Las comes de Bonaventun Des Pe'riers, Torino, 1965, 36. It is in my view inconceiv·
able that during the many months that Des Periers and Dolet worked together, and in
Lyons in the 1530s, they failed to discuss religion; 1 propose to examine Des Peziers's
attack on Dolet's atheism elsewhere.

¹³ Clement Marot is one, assuming his epigram Conlre l'inique, written around
1538, is, as has been supposed, directed at Dolet—cf. Chassaigne‚ op, cit„ 195-97. But
Lionello Sozzi surmised that the epigram was directed at Des periers—see “Marot,
Dolet, Des Periers e l'epigramma Contre l'inique,” Studi smncesi, V, 1961, 83-88. A
mysterious attack on Dolet byJean Binet may refer to his atheism: see J. Dupebe‚ “Un
poete neo-latin: jean Binet de Beauvais,” Me‘langae V. L. Saulnier (Geneve, 1984),
613-28, 625 n. 82.

¹⁴ That the enemy denounced by Vulteius is Dolet has been argued before, notably
by Lucien Febvre in Le Probleme de l’incwyance au seizieme siecle, la religion de Rabelais
(Paris, 1942), 48-60. My reading of the Cymbalum mundi strongly corroborates this
interpretation. Dolet’s religion (or lack of it) was attracting increasingly frequent
comment.

¹⁵ Diogo de Teive’s friendship with Dolet was held against him at his trial by the
Inquisition in Portugal: see R. Trinquet, La Jeunesse de Monlaigne, Paris, 1972, 500 n.
