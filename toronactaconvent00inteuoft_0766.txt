740 CHRlsT1AN EP1c THEoRY AND PRACTICE

praise of St, Sebastian, a Parthenodia in praise of the Virgin Mary, a short
work on the crucifixion of Christ, and others.

The best known work of Macarius Mutius, however, is undoubtedly De
triumpho Christi, printed in Venice in 1499ss It went through a number of
editions and was especially popular in Germany in the sixteenth century.
This paper briefly reviews the main arguments of De triumpho Christi's two
prefaces (described by Mario Di Cesare as “admirable'')5 and examines
their application in the poem itself. I would suggest that in his theory and
practice of Christian epic, Mutius points the way to the more ambitious
and better known Neo-Latin biblical epics of the sixteenth century.

Ι

In the first preface Mutius attacks the content of pagan poetry. The poet
could be a valued member of society, according to the knight from
Camerino, if he wrote works (as he should) celebrating mystica cerimonia-
rum sacra aut divinos hymnos aut heroum et fortium virorum gesta.⁶ Such
poetry serves a useful instructive purpose. Unfortunately, most pagan
poets chose unworthy topics. The eloquence of authors like Petronius,
Apuleius, and Lucian was not applied ad humanae vitae institutionem et
politicae rei utilitatem. Quite the contrary:

Quos clarissima ingenia doctrinam singularem et scribendi elegan-
tiam meretriciis amoribus et impurissimis scortorum lenociniis
maculare et divinae poetices dignitatem, sanctitatem, et gloriam ad
libidinem suam traducere ac turpiter foedare non puduit.

Even when the pagan poets wrote religious verse they still managed to be
lewd and lascivious. They told stories of the father of gods and men

⁴ A colophon in the first edition of De triumpho Christi informs the reader that it
was printed in Venice, 29 March 1499 during the reign of Augustino Barbadico. The
printersspublishers of De triumpho Christi are mentioned in the colophon. They are
the presbyter Franciscus Lucensis, cantor ecclesiae S. Marci (See F. J. Norton, Italian
Printers 1501-1520 [London‚ 1958]‚ 134-35) and Antonius Francisci, Venetus litterarum

artifex (see Mario Cosenza, Biographical and Bibliographical Dictionary ⁰s the Italian
Primers and osForeign Printers in Italy [Boston, 19681, 33).

⁵ Mario Di Cesare, Vida's Christiad and Vergilian Epic (New York and London,
1963)1,·131³·e and elsewhere in the paper 1 use the text of the 1499 edition (with some
minor alterations, mostly orthographic).
