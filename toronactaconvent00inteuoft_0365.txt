E. V. GEORGE 341

ty he established in the presence of the Virgin in the Genethliacon. He is
aiming at a more subtle and complex depiction of himself, but merely
produces sentiments that do not mesh with each other.

Inspection of the Somnium discloses that Vives alludes to himself
without the sels-uncertainty of the Aedes. He is quite nearly a nonentity
until well into the visit, when Insomnium, the being who fabricates realis-
tic dreams, recognizes him:

Insomnium . . . cum attentius perspexisset, agnovit congerronem.
“Papae! Tu es Vives,” inquit, “cui ego saepe soleo persuadere eum
modo cum Cicerone modo cum Quintiliano . . . versan’ et suavissime
disputari?” “Ipsissimus,'' inquam. . . . (Somn. 46)

Implicitly Vives, precisely because his soul is so susceptible to the utter
enchantment of the early greats, is a dupe. Paradoxically, his gullibility is
directly proportional to his legitimate and worthy dedication to the
classics. Self-deprecation and astuteness now go hand-in—hand.

Similarly, upon recognizing Cicero, Vives cleverly cozens him into a useful
conversation by pretending to be a partisan of Pompey’s party. Here is a
level of sophistication unobserved in the Genethliacon or the Aedes: the visitor
adopts a pose in order to collect the information he came to get. Cicero,
flattered‚ gladly agrees to put himself at the humanist teacher’s disposal. The
relationships portrayed surpass considerably the scenes in the Genethliacon
and the Aedes for subtlety; Vives accepts his low-profile position, equani-
mously absorbs aspersions on his capabiliu'es, and finally coaxes what he
wants out of the great orator. Vives has arrived at a level of coherence in a
convincing narrative previously unexhibited in this “fanciful journey” sen'es,
and at a remarkably sophisticated use of the device of selfdeprecation.

Finally, the Genethliacon, like the Aedes and the Somnium, is connected
with a scholarly treatise. For in December of either 1517 or 1518, Vives
dedicated to Serafin de Centelles, Count of Oliva, a work titled De tempore
quo, id est de pace, in qua natus est Christus (Vives, Opera Omnia, ed. Ma-
jansius, vol. 7:20-32). It is taken up mostly with a recitation of events in
Palestine and the rest of the Roman world leading up to the birth of
Christ, with a focus on the wars of that period and their sweeping termina-
tion with Augustus' third closure of the gates of the temple of Janus, the
age—old symbol of peace in the Roman world. A brief conclusion to the De
tempore alludes to prophecies of peace to come with the Messiah. The
general point is that secular history, with peace following long savage
conflict, confirms the prophecies. It is time for a census in the wake of the
gate-closing3Joseph and Mary are off to Bethlehem.

In the dedicatory epistle to the Genethliacon we find a phrase echoing
