456 CATULLAN NEo-LATm POETRY

century Pontano and Marullo are regarded to be the best Latin poets of
modern times, regardless of the fact that Erasmus accused them of pagan-
ism. It is not yet investigated which impact they had on the development
of Catullan poetry in the sixteenth century, in which it spread on the
transalpine nations. We do not yet see the full extent of this Neo-Catullan
poetry. But some observations allow the supposition that Catullan poets of
the sixteenth century were not alone in studying Catullus for this purpose,
but were also influenced by their Catullan predecessors in the fifteenth
century, especially by Pontano. In this way, Pontano‘s view and use of
Catullus guided humanists far into the seventeenth century in what they
saw in Catullus and how they tried to imitate his poetry.1
