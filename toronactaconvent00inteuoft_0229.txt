ning by proving its utility. The first paragraph is an extended paralipsiS‚ in
which he tells the reader that “To polissh out this point with those
effectuall reasons [regarding the necessity of running] were to me
nothing needefulll‘ As part of this circumlocutory device he maintains
that it is not necessary to tell “what Alexander the Macedonian, nor what
Papyrius the Romain did by swift foote, nor that Homere gave Achilles his
epithete of his footmanship’‘; he need only state “that running is an
exercise for health, which if reason cannot winne, whereof every man can
judge, sure historie will not.'’ In many other chapters, the histon‘cal proof
is often taken from the early chapters of De arm this time however
Mulcaster has gone elsewhere, to Sir Thomas Elyot who refers to Alexan-
der, Papirius, and “swifte foote Achilles’' in his observations on the
benefits of running in book l, chapter 16, of his Boke Named the Govemour.
Mulcaster then proceeds from his preliminary historica! proof to a division
of running by type: two kinds “vehement swift'’ and “gentle and modera-
te” he analyses at some length, and he concludes his chapter with the
“other kindes of running‚’' namely “long outright,” “streight backward,‘'
“round about‚’' “uphill,'‘ “downhill,” “in . . . clothes,” “out of . . . clothes,”
“in winter,'’ “in sommer.‘' All this is from Mercuriale, and is a condensa-
tion of five pages of De arte in which running is divided into “uelocius,
atque uehementius‚” “remissius 8c placidius,” “in rectum,” “in retro‚’' “cir-
culariter,‘’ “per accliuia,'’ “per decliuia,” “tecto corpore,” “nudi corporis,‘’
“in hyeme‚” and “in aestate‚” in the same order followed by Mulcaster.
The English follows the Latin closely, although a great deal has been
omitted. Most of the references to ancient authorities, for instance, have
been passed over—“sapienter Theodorus Priscianus scriptum reliquit,'' “ab
Aretaeo,” “a Celso,'’ “credidit Rufus Ephesius,” “secundum Antyllum‚’'
and similar formulae are dropped. Also left out are debates on the harms
of running to those with what Mulcaster translates as “an ill heade, or a
weake bulke, or burning and hoat urine” and on running in and out of
clothes. Throughout this chapter Mulcaster is intent on providing sure
opinion, not debate. To argue points pro and con would vitiate his delib-
erative style which must be strong and positive; moreover he would lose
the avowed central train of his topic, which is educafion, not medicine.
The only debate he gives in the chapter is at the very end, where he
mentions contrasting views on running in summer and winter, and pro—
vides a simple resolution. In the second half of the chapter there is only
one observation added to the material from Mercuriale, and that is the
image of a “chased [i.e., vexed, irritated] deare’' who must run from the
hunter but who would keenly like the hunter to “give him leave to
pisse”—a fanciful image to show the danger of running with a full bladder,
