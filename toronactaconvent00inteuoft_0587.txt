MARIANNE PAm: 563

a translator of Aristotle’s Analytica Posteriora, where his version is said to
compare favorably with the medieval one. Guarino asks Rossi to act as a
judge of his own translation, but he expresses this with some irony: he
uses a very elaborate image about his own inferiority as a translator
compared to Rossi, describing himself as Thersites, the ugliest man in the

army of Agamemnon, who could expect no praise from Ulysseisossi.¹⁰
Guarino’s humility in this passage forms a contrast to his tone at the end
of the letter, where he claims to be the intellectual relative of Rossi
through their common parent, Manuel Chrysoloras.¹¹

Rossi was the social superior of Guarino, and he belonged to the inner
circle of Florentine humanists, whom Guarino would somehow have to
please while teaching in that city. What is explicitly stressed in the letter is
not Rossi’s social rank, but his Greek learning, where Guarino could claim
to be his equal, though he professes the opposite. The purpose of the
letter, and of the Latin Flaminius, was to better Guarino's position among
the intellectuals of Florence; though he did not think himself inferior in
learning, he could not entirely overlook differences in social standing.

Eventually Guarino, not content with the milieu in Florence, sent the
Alexander and Caesar with a solemn dedication to a person of very high
rank. This was sometime before 1414, probably around 1412. The dedica-
teeffis explicitly said to have offered Guarino patronage‚¹² and Guarino
was presumably applying for a position at court-which as far as we know
he did not get. The formal structure is almost exactly as in the previous
letter, but Guarino elaborates two points far more than he did then. One
is the effect of the dedication: “Their own merits as well as their author
will secure these two great men, Alexander and Caesar, a great reputation
in posterity, but it would add infinitely to their esteem,'' Guarino says to
his addressee, “if they were dedicated to your name, just as people came
from afar to visit the celebrated statue in Olympia, not only because it was

cuius rationem in presentia tibi reddere institui, exercendi simul ingenioli ac me·
moriae causa T. Q. Flaminii vitam ex Plutarcho latine convertere aggressus sum.''
