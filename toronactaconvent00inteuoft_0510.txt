486 THE LITURGICAL CONTEXT OF ERASMUs's HYMNs

corresponding word-lengths, partly so as to provide a good fit for the
same melodic line. During the next three centuries assonance and rhyme
began to be added to the ends of the couplets until Adam of St. Victor, at
the end of the twelfth century, established a new pattern: pairs of rhym-
ing, accentually metrical strophes‚ which may be illustrated by the opening

pair of strophes from St. Thomas Aquinas's sequence for the feast of
Corpus Christi:

Lauda Sion salvatorem
lauda ducem et pastorem

in hymnis et canticis.
Quantum potes tantum aude,
quia maior omni laude:

nec laudare sufficis.³ ¹

In this form, often with a triplet instead of a couplet in each strophe,
literally thousands of sequences were written in the next three centur-ies.
Osten they were composed to fit a popular sequence melody.

Erasmus’s scattered remarks about the sequences of his time³² show
that he considered many of them trivial, inept‚ and unworthy of use in
divine worship because they introduced too much unlearned and legend-
ary material and because they were so long that they displaced or de-
emphasized more important parts of the mass. His strictures were appar-
ently not unjustified, since the Council of Trent swept away all the se-
quences except four: Victimae paschali (Easter)‚ Veni sancte spiritus (Pente-
cost), Lauda Sion salvatorem (Corpus Christi), and Dies irae, dies illa (Mass
for the Dead). And anyone who has spent some hours reading the vol-
umes devoted to sequences in Analecta hymnica can testify that many of
them seem tinklingly monotonous and trivial.

Hence we are not surprised that Erasmus's own sequence is relatively
short (thirty lines) and that he avoided the late-medieval rhyming pattern
by returning to the original scheme established by Notker. In fact, we
know from the testimony of Heinrich Glarean, a musician friend of
Erasmus, that he especially admired two of Notker's sequences.³³ Like
