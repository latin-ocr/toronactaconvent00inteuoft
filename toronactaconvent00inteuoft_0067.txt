of no examples where a poet explains why he has chosen Latin. A case in
many respects parallel to our poem is a verse-chronicle from c.1580
celebrating a noble family. It was written by a commonet, the poet Claus
Christophersen Lyschander, and as it was meant only for the noble family
itself, it was therefore not pn‘nted. Lyschander writes that he has chosen
Danish in order that the ladies of the family should not be excluded from
reading his poem. When you look at the painting forJorgen Rosenkrantz
with the members of his family so neatly divided up according to sex and
consider that it is hanging just opposite the bilingual verse-inscription, you
can almost see them reading: the men, Latin; and the women, Danish.⁹

The choice of language was by no means simple. Different consider-
ations intersected in a complex of inconsistent cn'teria: Latin for an
international audience, Danish for a national one. Latin for the educated‚
Danish for the uneducated. Latin for the commoners, Danish or German
for the aristocracy. Latin for men, Danish for women. Latin for personal
messages, Danish for general ones. Shortly afterwards, King Freden‘c II
had a similar choice to make for the texts of a magnificent series of
tapestries, woven to decorate his new castle of Kronborg in Elsinore. The
motif was highly representative: the complete list of Danish kings. Even
though he had both Latin and Danish poems at his disposal, he finally
chose German.¹⁰

The balance among the various possible languages shifted somewhat
during the century. Fifty years earlier, the first generation of Danish
humanists had been guided by their enthusiasm for learning, their nation-
alism, and their concern for popular education, and they were very much
aware of the possibilities offered by the printing press. Thus Christian
Pedersen had had the great Latin history of Denmark by the mediaeval
scholar Saxo Grammaticus printed in Paris in 1514.¹¹ It had an obvious
message for an international as well as for a national audience, that of

⁹ Besides Lyschander, 1 refer to Rasmus Hansen Reravius' introduction to Frederik
II's og Dronning Sophies Kronings og Bryllups Historie (Copenhagenz Lor. Benedicht
1576). When in 1560 the German poet Hieronymus Osius described a war fought by
the Danish King, he dedicated a Latin version to the King and a German one to
Electress Anna of Sachsen (Karen Skovgaard-Petersen has drawn my attention to this).
It fits into this pattern that Anders Sorensen Vedel dedicated his collection of Danish
ballads to Queen Sophie (1591).
