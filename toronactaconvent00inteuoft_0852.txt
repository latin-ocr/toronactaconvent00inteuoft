826 VIVES'S DE EUROPAE DISSIDIIS ET BELLO TURCICO

of the polarities of the contemporary political discourse. This reworking
of language is, in a sense, not surprising, since all of the Valencian’s
writing reflect the preoccupation with the relationship between res and
verba logical in a writer who is twice bilingual. In the historical divide
between proponents of a “natural’' and “conventional'' nature of lan-
guage, Vives falls into the second camp.¹⁰ Words such as “barbarus”
(454) and “haeresis'’ (455) are for Vives culturally relative. Political dis-
course in particular reveals what he calls the “stulta ambitio nominis sine
re’‘ (466), verba unrelated to any existing res. In De dissidiis, he unmasks
the manipulators of empty language, whether it is Europeans who band
together in “foedus quod sanctum appellarunt'’ (462), or those who are
“Christian'’ in name only.

In De dissidiis, the most important neutralization operates on antitheses
expressing cultural antagonisms and their respective moral worlds: Eu-
rope] Asia, ChristianssTurks, LutheranssCatholics, and Spaniardssltalians.
The author defuses the antithesis TurkssEuropeans, for example, by
pointing the finger at his own Europe. The origin of the Turkish threat
for Vives is largely the fault of Christian insolidarity—‘‘dissidia'’——and is, in
view of the idea, common in that period, of the weakness of Asia and
strength of Europe, an historical anomaly. It is the Christian princes, eager
to destroy rather than reform their fellow leaders (455) who are responsi·
ble for the Turkish advance.

Vives also neutralizes political polarities by equating Turks and Chris-
tians. If a question of Minos—“Quid agunt principes? quid Christiani? quid
Turca?” (454)-suggests contrasting groups, Polypragmon’s answer identi-
fies the two groups: “Propemodum eadum ista, et bellum ubique, dis-
cordiae, odia'' (454). The author applies this formula of equation to
European affairs as well. Faction-ridden friars are counterbalanced by
uncharitable Lutherans (455), and the abuses of the Spanish soldier
weighed against those of the Italian soldier (462-63).

Through the reformulation of antitheses—wius lose, triumphs defeat,
famesshame—as identities Vives dismantles conventional discourse and
forges a new vocabulary of anti-fame and anti-glory. The Pyrrhic victory is
the paradigm of the battle descriptions in the dialogue. One encounter,

panicum: Medieval and Golden Age studies presented to Dorothy Clotelle Clarke, eds. J. S.
Geary et alii (Madisonz Univ. of Wisconsin Press‚ 1983). As E. Cosen'u has shown
(“Acerca de la teoria del lenguaje‚” 66), Vives does not reject in theory a “lingua
perfectissima,” but generally treats languages as culturally determined entities.
