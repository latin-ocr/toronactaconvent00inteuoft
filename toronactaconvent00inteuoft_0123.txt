We can now look to Erasmus and Thomas More for further illustration
of the Renaissance use of classics in the writing ofbiography. Erasmus has
been studied intensively by Bietenholz, who emphasizeS, quite rightly,
aspects of biography as history—although 1 believe, as 1 have tried to make
clear, that biography must be considered under the aegis of rhetoric as
well. In the view of Bietenholz, Erasmus “expressed a profound concern
with the truth of all historical knowledge acquired by man, a concern that
advanced the humanistic spirit of inquiry and foreoest many facets of the
complex historica} thought of the modern age.”¹⁸

Erasmus wrote several lives himself, and they differ considerably. In his
Hieronymi vita he wrote a life that was history (in the terms of Bietenholz),
and it was written to accompany his great edition ofJerome in 1516, on
which Professor John Olin has been working.¹⁹ The edition and the Vita
Hieronymi measure Erasmus‘ lifelong dedication to the study of Jerome
and his work, which mattered in two principal ways to Erasmus. first,
because jerome was the great translator of and commentator upon the
Bible, and because Jerome’s fusion of classical studies and Scripture was
a fountain of inspiration for Erasmus and his concept of philosophia
Christi: ex purissimis sontibus, Christi philosophiam hauriebat, Erasmus wrote
in his Vita.²⁰ There Erasmus first criticized the use of fictitious stories
and vindicated the “Saint in the face of medieval and incompetent biogra-
phers.”²¹ Then follows a detailed biographical account from birth to
death, proceeding to opinions on Jerome’s virginity and on the merits of

Garin, L’educazione in Europa, 1400-1600 (Bari, 1957). For 3 history of the scholarship
involved in study of the classics (to be adjusted by more recent studies at a number os
points), J. E. Sandys, A History os Classical Scholarship from the Sixth Cerumy B.C. to the
End os the Middle Ages, 3 vols. (Cambridgez Cambridge Univ. Press, 1903-8).

¹⁸ Bietenholz, Histoi) and Biography, 12. For any humanist in the sixteenth century
there were serious problems in the meaning of history and in the ways of writing
history, and biography may well bc considered, at least in part, under the aegis of
history. But it needs to be studied as rhetoric, and in other ways as well.

¹⁹ John C. Olin has stressed the Viea's mode as an encomium and also a plea:
