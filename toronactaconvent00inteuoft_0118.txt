102 NEC-LATIN RESOURCES FOR BIOGRAPHY

theory of history. But what is involved in mimesis is of course the concept
of imitatio, which Ι have attempted to discuss in rather enlarged terms in
‘⁴ ‘Lighting a Candle to That Place. . . .’''³ In this paper I shall offer a
sketch, necessarily provisional‚ of the potentials for our study of Renais-
sance biography that are to be found in the prefaces and commentaries
upon classical and patristic authors. For the concern of this program is to
examine the writing of lives of Thomas More done in the sixteenth
century. These Renaissance biographies were written by humanists‚ that is
to say, by men—and what a pity that we do not have a biography by one of
the women of More's family or school: what would we not give for a life
of More by Margaret Roper.

To be sure, there were also patristic and medieval models—of which
only a small proportion of the later medieval writings were not in Lat-
in—and all of these shared, with differences‚ the conventions of rhetorical
development of subject and topoi. Thus, notably, the tradition of the
saint's life—the legends of the saints that were intended to be read individ—
ually as well as communally for instruction and following⁴—and this
tradition was still a powerful influence in both religious life and literature
in the sixteenth century. With the early lives of the founders of the
Brethren of the Common Life, for example, one finds lives that are
molded in the tradition of the saint's life. Some of us have argued for the
influence of this saint's life tradition in the shaping of Roper’s Life os More,
for the work is constructed around the holding forth as the virtue iconi-
fied More’s superlative virtue of conscience, his “cleere unspotted con-
science.''⁵ Even here as well, there is the as yet not fully studied question
of how much the classical rhetorical tradition provided techniques and
models for the late-medieval saints’ lives, like those in the tradition of the
Brethren of the Common Life and the congregation of the Canons of St.
Augustine.⁶ This question is the more important because of the customs

dition that emphasized oral reading, as Ι have summarized in a chapter on Erasmus’
spirituality in Erasmus Grandescens (Nieuwkoop: B. DeGraaf, 1988). The Imitation of
Christ cuts across several of the lines that 1 have been developing, with its vigorously
emphasized concept of imitating or following Christ, in a work to be read individually

and communally. See also The Achievement os Thomas More (Victoria, B.C.: English
Literary Studies, 1976), 40-41.
