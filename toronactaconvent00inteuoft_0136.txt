l 18 ERASMUS ΟΝ METAPHOR

in an abstract sense. In other wordS, rememben‘ng Cicero’s contention
that Latin lacked vocabulary, we can imagine that those terms that are
missing from the language are terms that could render abstract meanings
literally. Somehow, the universe of concrete experience needed first to be
recruited into the cause of metaphysics, and then to be expunged from
metaphysics. Metaphysics thus blanches out the concrete associations that
linger on and appropriates terminology that is in effect no longer evocative
of the sensory world. It is such a step that allows Erasmus to refer to lan-
guage as “natural'’ without its having anything to do with physical nature.

This, according to Derrida, is the “Aristotelian ideal,'' to which philoso—
phy aspires. I suggest that this ideal plays a paradoxical role in Erasmus’s
writing. We can gain insight into the matter by looking at Erasmus's
portrayal of two stages in the evolution of language. The first occurs as a
result of catastrophe, or falling from grace. That perfect emblem of
fallenness, Folly‚ puts the case as follows:

Siquidem simplex illa aurei seculi gens, nullis armata disciplinis, solo
naturae ductu, instinctuque vivebat. Quorsum enim opus erat Gramma-
tica, cum eadem esset omnibus lingua, nec aliud sermone petebatur,
nisi ut alius alium intelligeret? Quis usus Dialectices, ubi nulla erat pug—
nantium inter se sententiarum dimicatio? Quis Rhetoricae locus, cum
nullus alteri negotium facesseret?. . . At labente paulatim aetatis aureae
puritate, primum a malis, ut dixi, geniis inventae sunt artes. . . ‚²¹

We see that the sciences of which she speaks are those of the trivium,
imposed on mankind by evil forces who saw and exploited man's falling
away from a community of understanding and transparent use of lan·
guage. Fighting and troublemaking were the cause and the result of the
fall, which is charted in the language that prevails before and after. Of
course, Folly's voice is deliberately intended to be suspect—the very least
one can say about this passage is that it shows Erasmus poking fun at his
own immediate areas of concern, and thus that the passage is a playful
attempt at self-denigration. Yet behind the exaggeration there is an ideal
of language asserting itself that has more than a hint of Stoicism to it.
There is no need for sciences of language in the Golden Age because
language already does exactly what it ought to do: communicate meaning.
At the same time, people also do what they ought: live in harmonious
community, understanding and reflecting one another’s best interests, so
that no persuasion is necessary.
