56 LATIN IN 16TH-CENTURY DANISH CULTURE

the whole first year, comes on September 8th and says: “Market day is
held in Ribe.‘’ Over the years, Danish spreads more and more so as to
become the normal language of the notes, with Latin as number two;
German disappears, while Greek and even Hebrew remain for casual use.
This is, of course, the development of an individual‚ and the initial domi-
nance of Latin is connected with the fact that the author lived in a univer—
sity milieu and spoke the language regularly. But it is noteworthy how well
Latin keeps its position long after Peder Hegelund had established himself
in Ribe. And the pattern fits well enough into the general picture offered
by other sources.

Languages used by Peder Hegelund in his calendar notes, 1565-1613:

Hegelund made his calendar notes for his own use, so here the choices
of language were not made with readers in mind, except for the few notes
in Hebrew. They occur at stages in the author's life when he considered
marrying and mentioned the women he had in mind. The idea was
probably to safeguard such notes against unwanted readers.¹⁷ In some

¹⁷ This is what the editor, Bue Kaae, suggests p. XVI; a further possibility is that
Hegelund found the exotic Hebrew form more romantic than Latin or Danish.
