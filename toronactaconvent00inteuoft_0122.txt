106 NEo—LAT1N RESOURCES FOR BIOGRAPHY

the same time—was now available in a complete Latin translation by
Ficino, so the Lives of Plutarch were now accessible in a complete Latin
translation. Interest naturally continued and deepened.¹‘¹

In 1509 Michael Hummelberg, who was associated in editing classical
texts with Lefevre d’Etaples and Josse Bade, and who became a close
associate and friend of Beatus Rhenanus, wrote about the writing and
teaching of Girolamo Aleandro; for Aleandro had been working on the
Aldine edition of Plutarch’s Moralia in 1507, and in Paris in 1509 Alean-
dro was lecturing on Greek and publishing three treatises by Plutarch with
Gourmont. In the ambitious preface to this Plutarchan work, Aleandro
spoke to students of the true philosophy (that is, not scholasticism) and
promised to edit and explain all the Greek authors—poetS, orators, histori-
ans, philosophers, theologiam, and Fathers of the Church—a breathtaking-
ly ambitious proposal, even for a twenty-nine year old. In the preface to
this work he spoke of Plutarch: “Quod hactenus feci in tribus hisce, quos
Latine exposituri sumus, gravissimi scriptoris Plutarchi commentariis,
facturus itidem. . . .''¹⁵ Clearly a sense of the importance of commentaries
is underscored here.

In l5l4Josse Bade (who, as we know, published much of Erasmus and
More), re-edited the Lives of Plutarch, with the help of a student of
Aleandm’s, Gerard de Verceil.16 The preface by Bade is addressed to
Aleandro and is dated l December 1514. In the text (which is provided by
Renouard, volume III), we can see the new emphases of humanists in the
reading and teaching of biography.¹⁷

¹⁴ One sees an interest in Plutarch as a moral philosopher, of course, as with
Guillaume Bude’s translation of four treatises of Plutarch: De placitis philosophorum, De
fortuna Romanorum (1503), and De tranquillitate et securitate animi and De fortuna vel
virtute Alexandri (1505). Thus Plutarch was thought to be “juge equitable des scetes et
maitre delicat de morale pratique”: A. Renaudet, Prbrifomne et Humanisme ἁ Paris

Bietenholz et al., vol. 1 (Torontm Univ. of Toronto Press, 1985), 29, on Aleandro.
Aleandro had a spurt of enormous productivity from 1509 to 1514, and this led to his
becoming principal of the College des Lombards from 1511 and being appointed
rector of the university in March 1513.

¹⁷ Bietenholz discusses the question of history and biography with respect to
Erasmus, but without considering the question of how biography might be taught. For
