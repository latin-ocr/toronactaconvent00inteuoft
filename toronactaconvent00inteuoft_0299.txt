PAUL M. CLOGAN 275

this time he assumed the Latin name Domitius in accordance with the
practice of friends and students of Pomponio Leto. He was appointed
professor of rhetoric at Rome by Paul 11 in 1470, and he continued in that
office under Sixtus IV, who made him apostolic secretary in 1471. In 1472
he traveled with Bessarion to France, and in 1473 he traveled to Florence
to work in the Bibliotheca Medicea where he met the young Poliziano,
Bartolomeo Fonzio, and Marsilio Ficino. In 1476 he traveled to Avignon
in the company of Cardinal Giuliano della Revere.

Calderinus was an irascible controversialist during his career, and his
opponents included Niccolo Perotti on Martial and Angelo Cneo Sabino and
Perotti on Juvenal. Shortly before Calderinus died G. Merula published an
attack on the commentary on Martial, which was answered by Cornelio
Vitelli. After he died, Poliziano severely attacked his scholarship and veracity.

His commentary on the Silvae was printed in Rome by Arnoldus
Pannartz on 1 August 1475 and was repn‘nted at least ten times between
1475 and 1671. In addition to his commentary on the Silvae, Calderinus
wrote commentaries on Cicero's letters to Atticus,Juvenal, Martial, Ovid’s
Ibis, Metamorphoses and Sappho, some passages of Propertius, Suetonius,
and some of Virgil’s minor poems; and he is said to have written commen-
tan'es on Catullus, Persius, and Silius. He died before finishing a Latin
translation of Pausanias. In 1483, 1490, 1494, and 1498 editions of his
commentary on the Silvae are very interesting from a humanistic point of
view because they also contain the commentaries of Maturantius on the
Achilleid and Lactantius Placidus on the Thebaid

Franciscus Maturantius was born at Perugia in 1443 and studied at
Vicenza, where he was a pupil of Ognibene da Lonigo.⁵ Later he traveled
for two years in Greece, especially Rhodes, studying Greek and collecting
Greek manuscripts. In 1475 he was appointed secretary to Niccolo Perotti,
governor of Perugia, and tutor to his nephews. He held office under
Lorenzo Zane, governor of Perugia in 1483, and he was elected professor
of eloquence at Perugia in 1486 and succeeded Ognibene da Lonigo at
Vicenza in 1492. After a year of studying philosophy in Venice, Maturan-
tius declined professorships at Rome, Venice, Udine, and Cesena and
finally returned to teaching at Perugia in 1498. During the latter part of
his life he was appointed to van'ous chancellorships and ambassadorships.
