placed in an imaginary setting submit to a conflict that enables them to
elicit the probable from the possible and to attain a resolution instructive
to the reader. In placing dialogue in a via media between the thematics of
expository prose and the techniques of direct discourse, Sigonius views
dialogue as a hybrid form. Like Aristotle who classifies the mimes of
Sophron and Xenarchus and Socratic conversations as a nameless art
which is conveyed by words alone (Poetics 1447b)‚ Sigonius recognizes the
qualities that distinguish dialogue from established poetic forms. But the
character portrayal implicit in the definition of dialogue requires Sigonius
to rework Aristotle's thoughts. Sigonius, though, does not depart entirely
from Aristotelian thought; for, in justifying dialogue as a poetic form, he
follows Aristotle‘s methodology of examining literary kinds through their
use of things, means, and manners:

Res, quas poetae imitando simularent, aut graviorum, aut leviorum
hominum, aut qui his interiecti essent, actiones esse invenit; instru-
menta, quae ad imitandum afferrent, orationem esse, concentum, et
rhythmum; modus ineundae imitationis, cum iidem aut perpetua
uterentur narratione, aut quasi agentes inducerent, aut utrumque.

(p.30)

The repetition of the word imitatio reflects the centrality of mimesis in
Sigonius’s theory of dialogue. For Sigonius, the imitation of the “actions
of men” consists in the copying of words that convey a “serious or light
character or a mixture of the two.'' Plato's three modes of imitation are
useful to his theorization: “(l) pure narrative, in which the poet speaks in
his own person without imitation, as in the dithyramb; (2) narrative by
means of imitation, in which the poet speaks in the person of his charac-
tem, as in comedy and tragedy; and (3) mixed narrative, in which the poet
speaks now in his own person and now by means of imitation.”8 Obvious·
ly, the second and third sorts of discourses conform to Sigonius’s concep-
tion of the imitation of human actions in dialogic form, and thereby
enable him to define dialogue as a genus of poetry.

By defming the speech of men as the object of representation, Sigonius
offers guidelines by which the reader-critic may classify a poetic work.
History, or the chronicling of events in narrative, would not meet his

classification of these modes of discourse is based upon Plato, Republic 392d-394c.
