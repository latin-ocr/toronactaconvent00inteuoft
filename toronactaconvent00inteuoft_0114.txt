98 PUNS, PARADOXES‚ AND HEURISTIC INQUIRY

the “De Servis'' section. Whether we read that remark straightforwardly
(the gloss asks us to admire Utopia’s “aequitas''), take it as an ironic aside
with respect to the problem of prisoners of war or the larger war problem,
or read it both ways, its presence is striking. And it signals a recurrent
concern that reappears in the segments on marriage and the law and
becomes wholly overt in the discourse on treaty-making and breaking.
Finally Raphael Hythlodaeus falls into diatribe as he concludes that “all
justice” [iustitia tota] seems to be “a plebeian and low virtue which is far
below the majesty of kings'' (199s10-11). Or else there are at least two
forms of it: one fit for the common people, “bound by many chains,'' the
other for kingS, and so free that “every thing is permissible to it—-except
what it finds disagreeable” (199s16-17). Thanks, in part, to the litotic
negations that open the text and intensify a dilemma that Erasmus also
addressed in his Education osa Christian Prince, the Latin is stronger still:
“cui nihil non liceat nisi quod non libeat’' (198s13-14)—that is, to which
nothing is not permitted except what does not please.¹⁷ The instruments
of justice are made the instruments of injustice, and Hythlodaeus, albeit
speaking as an iconoclast‚ is, from our perspective, prophetie about the
powers of the king as these developed in the course of the 1520s and 30s
in England and elsewhere.

It is easy to characterize Hythlodaeus’s position and feel his moral
outrage. Here, proleptically‚ is the voice of the revolutionary. Itis harder,
however, to characterize the point of view of the author, who will subse-
quently find himself challenging monarchal power at the cost of his life
while using every legal means to try to preserve it. Like Plato, Augustine,
and Erasmus, More is preoccupied with justice and equity‚ and he is
extraordinarily sensitive to the abuseS‚ aberrations, and misuses of justice
in Western Europe in 1516. But he writes as the lawyer he is as well as a
philosopher, politician, and creative writer; hence the preoccupation, at
once serious and playful, with contracts and bonds and his preference for
concrete cases that problematize the text and let him open up questions
about values, in general, and justice, equity‚ and the meaning of communi-
ty‚ in particular.¹⁸ Moreover, Raphael Hythlodaeus's final diatribe is,
from one point of view, a too-easy generalization of justice] injustice that

in such a way that nothing pleases you which is not permissible . . .'’ (218).
