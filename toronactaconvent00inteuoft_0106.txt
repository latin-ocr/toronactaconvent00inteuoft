90 THOMAS STAPLETON’S USE or MORE’s ENGLISH WORKs

More’s English Works also yielded information for Stapleton's life of
Thomas Becket. He learned from More, he says, that Becket bore the first
brunt of Protestant iconoclasm: the destruction of the statue of Becket on
London Bridge was an omen of the wholesale assault which was to take
place in 1538 by royal edict.⁷

Thus Stapleton’s glosses, underlinings, and vertical lines in More's
English Works show how carefully and thoroughly he read that folio
volume in preparation for his Vita Mori. A comparison of his Latin with
the passages he translated from More's English would also reveal his skill
and accuracy as a translator.

handwritten comments on the Oscott College copy of the Epistola adversus Pomeranum
“are by Stapleton and should throw light on his Life os More.”

⁷ In his Debellation os Salem and Bizance More wrote: “some . . . pulled downe of
late vpon London bridge the image of the blessed martyr sayne [sic] Thomas” (93512).
