begins: “The author differreth the answer. . . .” Above this Stapleton has
written: “He aunswereth in the viijth chapter of the seconde boke”—which
seems to indicate that he has turned the ensuing leaves all the way to page
147. In the bottom margin of page 159, an even longer entry about “the
refutatyon of Tyndall’‘ directs the reader to “the thyrde booke’' of More’s
Confutation, “fol. 487 D.” The sixteenth and last chapter of book 3, in
which “the author sheweth his mind, that it wer conuenient to haue the
byble in englishe'' contains an unusual wealth of response from Stapleton:
no fewer than seven passages are underlined on page 241 alone. The
margin bears an X and a large O; the numbers l, 2, 3, 4 mark the clergy’s
arguments against allowing the bible to fall into the hands of the laity, and
the refutations of these specious reasons. The last number, 5, occurs on
page 242, and the markings continue to be frequent to the end of that
beautifully balanced chapter (including a reference to the Confutation:
“Vide authorem fo 849 H”).

Where More surveys “the bookes of Tindall and hys felowes'’ in his
preface to the Consumtion, the folio pages 341-43 are one solid continuum
with no physica} guide to individual tides—a mere “'I'hen'' introduces each
new item. To provide signposts along this path Stapleton numbers the
works in the margin, from 1 to 16, and underlines such key terms or
names as “newe testament booke of obedience saynt Iohn . ..
beggars . . . George 1aye” and so on. Further on in the same important
preface, he draws a square to frame the end of a paragraph (3510), puts
a “nota” at 351G, and adds a few further glosses: “obedience that he—
retyques teacheth'’ (above 353A); “Bookes of deuotion” (at the bottom of
page 356, where More recommends Hilton, Gerson, and Bonaventure);
“Sim’' (356G) to mark the poisons treacle image which Stapleton himself
later used in the title of one of his biblical works: Antidota, that is, a
“treacle’' against the poison of Calvin and Beza.

Stapleton’s captions can be quite revealing of his own leanings and em-
phases. In book 7 of the Confutation‚ after More (for the eleventh time, at
least, in his polemical career) has quotedJames 2:20 (“Faith without good
works is dead,” 711D), one might expect a post-Tridentine professor to
write “fides sine operibus” as the Vulgate has it, but the actual gloss is
“fides sine charitate,” as if in echo of More’s own formulation in the letter
to Bugenhagen: “caritatis opera, sine quibus fides mortua est.'’⁵
