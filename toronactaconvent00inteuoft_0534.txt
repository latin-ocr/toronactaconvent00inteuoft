510 PRINTED COMMONPLACE BOOKS

Such a prescription goes to the core of humanist teaching and focusses
our attention on distinctive features of the literary culture that teaching
produced. Chytraeus presupposes a canon of approved writers privileged
for entry into the commonplace book. Whatever the ostensible subject of
these writers, Chytraeus proposes a paradigmatic approach to them, which
essentially identifles their productions as rheton'c. This approach involves
the break-down of any given passage into its constituent places, or topics;
the recognition of particular figures of thought or speech; the juxtaposi-
tion, under appropriate headings in the note—book, of the treatment of
analogous themes and the use of parallel modes of expression by various
writers; and ultimately, but as an integral part of the process of reception,
the genesis of verbal composition which is basically a reproduction or an
assembly or a variation of antecedent texts. Prescriptions for common-
place books correlate exactly with contemporary literary commentaries,
where suitable passages for extrapolation are signalled by asterisks or
quotation marks, and marginal notes suggest the heads under which they
might be placed. Books in every scholastic discipline are indexed by
topics, or “digested into commonplaces,‘' as the publicity jargon of the
day expresses it. The role of memory in reading and of imitation in
writing‚ and of intertextuality in both, is reinforced by the commonplace
book. Yet, despite its centrality to the humanist enterprise, there has as yet
been no overall history of the Renaissance commonplace book, much less
any attempt to provide a descriptive bibliography even of printed exam-
ples (which were far outnumbered at the time by manuscript note-books
for pn‘vate use). It is not my intention here to embark on such a history,
but merely to indicate how interesting that history might be, by briefly
glancing at a very few of the earliest of these books and by suggesting the

sort of questions they raise.²

² One of the main problems to be faced in any such history is the extremely
confused terminology of “places’' in Renaissance dialectic and rhetoric. The present
paper deliberately side-steps the issue, but it is confronted in the two most valiant
attempts so far to survey the field of commonplace books: M..J Lechner, Renaissance
Concepts ο] the Commonplaces (New York, 1962, Westport, 1974); E. Mertner‚ “Topos
und Commonplace“ in Topossovschung. Eine Dokumentation, ed. P. Jehn (Frankfurt,
1972), 20-68. These studies are full of insights, but partia] in historical coverage. For
further information, but again limited in scope, see: P. Porteau, Montaigne et la vie
pe‘dagogique de son temps (Geneva‚ 1935); B. L. Ullman‚ “Joseph Lang and his antholo-
gies” in Middle Ages, Resormation, Volkskunde. Festschrift sor John G. Kunstmann (Chapel
Hill, 1959), 186—2003 A. Buck, Die humanistische Tradition in der Romania (Bad Hom-
burg, 1968), 133-50; W. J Ong, Rhetoric, Romame, and Technology (Ithaca, New York,
1971); B. Beugnot‚ “Florileges et Polyantheae. Diffusion et statut du lieu commun ὲ
