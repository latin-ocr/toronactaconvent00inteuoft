Then follows a short paragraph in which Grotius suggests that an appeal
to Holy Writ would be the ideal solution, except that by and large Holy
Writ gives only historical accounts, in which ordinarily the wrong course of
action is described, or it gives the Hebrew law rather than the divine law.

The true way, then, has been prepared for us by those jurists of
antiquity whose names we revere, and who repeatedly refer the art
of civil government back to the very fount of nature. This is the
course indicated also in the works of Cicero. For he declares that the
science of law must be derived, not from the Praetor's edict. . . ‚ nor
yet from the Twelve Tables. . . ‚ but from the inmost heart of phi-
losophy. . . . Nevertheless, it will be of no slight value as a confirma-
tion of our belief, if the conviction already formed by us on the basis
of natural reason is sanctioned by divine authority, or if we find that
this same conviction was approved in earlier times by men of wis-
dom and by nations of the highest repute. (7)

Who are “those jurists of antiquity whose names we revere'’? Grotius
does not name them, but in a marginal note he simply mentions certain
tities in Justinian's Digest.

Now he spells out the method to be followed: first, laying down certain
general rules and laws, “presenting them as preliminary assumptions
which need to be recalled rather than learned for the first time, with the
purpose of laying a foundation upon which our other conclusions may
safely rest'' (ibid.).

In the sequel, Grotius devotes a chapter to spelling out nine “mles'’
and thirteen “laws,’' from which supposedly the solutions of actual contro-
versies in international law could be deduced. These rules and laws,
however, are extremely general. Among them one finds, inter alia, that
“what God has shown to be His Will, that is law''; that “what the common
consent of mankind has shown to be the will of all, that is law''; that it is
permissible to defend one’s own life, to acquire for oneself “those things
which are useful for life,’' that no one may inflict injury or seize posses-
sion of what is possessed by another, that evil deeds must be corrected
and good deeds recompensed.‘¹ But how can we bridge the gap between
