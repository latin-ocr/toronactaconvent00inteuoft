774 ERASMus’s PRECATloNEs

that is one of Erasmus's earliest compositions (dating back to about
1500);32 (b) the prayer “Pro pace ecclesiae‚'' written in 1532, and also
invoking Jesus³³ (this prayer is often confused with the previous one);
and (c) the Precatio Dominio-(2³⁴ of 1523, which Erasmus on occasion
described as “a paraphrase of the Lord’s Prayer.'‘³⁵

Thus, the Precationes novae of 1535 include prayers from the period
between 1500 and 1535, the latter half of Erasmus's life. The readers have
noticed that, whereas the early prayer to Jesus is included, the Obsecratio
and the Paean, written shortly before, are not. The latter are the prayers
to Mary, with whose texts, as we have seen, Erasmus soon became dissatis-
fied and that, certainly after 1519, he was not very happy about.

Moreover, Erasmus must have been well aware of the fact that the
Obsecratio and the Paean would have been totally unacceptable to adher-
ents of the Reformation; had he reprinted these texts, he would unneces-
sarily have estranged them from himself—which would not have been in
agreement with his prayer “pro pace ecclesiae.’' Although in the Modus
orandi he does defend the invocation of Mary and the saints, he does so in
the moderate manner we have come to know so well from his other
writings. However, Erasmus was always at pains to point out that praying
to God and to Christ is to be preferred under all circumstances
(“tutius’'³⁶ etc.).

Taking a closer look at the Precationes with this background in mind, we
find that the prayers to, successively‚ the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit, are followed by a prayer “ad virginem Matrem,’' whose first line is
“Ave Maria.” This prayer is striking in that it is not a prayer in the proper
sense of the word. Nothing is asked of Mary, not even her intercession. In
the editio princeps this is emphasized by the running titles: whereas those
of the first prayers read “precatio ad patrem‚'’ “precatio ad filium,'' or
“precatio ad spiritum sanctum,'' that of the prayer to Mary reads “salutatio
ad virginem matrem.’'

1 suppose that this book of Precationes was read by Protestants too, and
it seems likely that it was compiled with an eye to this particular reader-
ship as well. In this connection it should be noted that the Precationes
include prayers for the sick and dying, but not for the dead. Finally, 1
