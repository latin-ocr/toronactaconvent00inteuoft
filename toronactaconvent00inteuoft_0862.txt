836 THE LATIN PoEMs OF TYCHo BRAHE

university‚ and perhaps also its leader. And then there are three poems
adressed to amateur scientists among the Danish nobility. No doubt Tycho
was also the centre of a clique of such persons.⁷

In my opinion one of these poemS, the one addressed to the alchemist
Erik Lange, has very special qualities.⁸ It's a love elegy-and this is
stressed by the fact that each of its forty-three distichs ends with the word
amor. Its tone is (as very often with Tycho Brahe) distinctly Ovidian, and
the theme is advice to a friend who is hopelessly in love. In spite of all
that it's no genuine love poem.

The beginning is quite traditional, describing love as an illness that
prevents you from occupying yourself with other things—here, according to
the recipient (and the sender) of the poem, specified as poet1y‚ chemistiy
and astronomy.⁹ But then Tycho presents a sort of remedium amoris which
takes us much further. To get n’d of this love Erik must replace it by another
one. If he is vexed by Venus and by Cupid's arrows, he must substitute them
with a love for Pallas. If he can't sleep at night, there's always the love for
Urania and her stars. And if it's Cupid’s fire that bothers him, the substitute
is Vesta’s fire, i.e., chemistiy. The three arts recur.

Si te blanda Venus per tela Cupidinis urget,
Palladis egregius substituatur amor.

Si nocturna qvies nimium frustratur amore,
Urania astriferae sit tibi noctis amor.
Sive Cupidineo te nox qvoqve conficit igne,
Sit tibi Vestarum lucidus ignis amor.

(vv. 29-34)

Rantzau, Viceroy of Holstein: Opera omnia, 9:187-90. Epitaphs for two professors at
Copenhagen University,Johannes Pratensis and Hans Frandsen: Opera omnia, 9:176-77
and 178. To three noblemen: Erik Lange (Opera omnia, 15:3-5), Jacob Ulfeldt (Opera
omnia, 9:179-80) and Falk Gjoe (not extant, see previous note). — The no longer
extant poem for the French ambassador, Charles de Dancay, is mentioned among the

others in a handwritten list of poems, preserved in the National Library in Vienna
(cod. Vindob. 10.686 10 fol. lla), as is also a poem to “Prof.<?> Nicolaus Laurentius‚”
who may be identified as the leader (rector) of the University of Copenhagen for 1585.
⁸ This poem is the subject of my article “Amor pa Hven, Tycho Brahes digt til Erik
Lange” (see note 3), which also contains an edition of the poem which on some points
differs from the text in the Opera omnia.
⁹ A series of items which recurs several times in Tycho’s poems, e.g., in two other

poems from the same “series”: the one to Heinrich Rantzau (Opera omnia, 9:189, lines

27-32) and the epitaph for Johannes Pratensis (Opera omnia, 9:176, lines 23-8). Also
in one of the poems in “De Nova Stella” (Opera omnia, 1:14, line 23).
