360 SCALIGER, VINET, AND THE TEXT OF AUSONIUS

Nowhere in all this narrative does Vinet complain about Scaliger or
anyone else. The only place where one might detect recrimination is in
the statement “but Scaliger thought he should do more than he prom-
ised.'' He even speaks of Scaliger's benevolentia; he calls Salomo, the
intermediary, benevolus et doctus, and does not as one might expect curse
or even censure the printer for procrastination. It might even seem as if
Vinet did not greatly object to the delay; he was always a man with, so to
speak, a very long fuse. Conceivably the printer was holding out for a
commentary to accompany the text; if so, he was not the first of Vinet’s
printers to be disappointed in him.

Now for Scaliger’s letter. What does the suspect have to say for himself?
He gives an account of his dealings with Greyff, which <in modern jargon)
were reactive rather than proactive. He states that he put the works of
Ausonius in a new order: this is quite correct. He says that he noted
changes that others had made to the text in the previous fifty yearS, and
identified the authors of these changes: this is partly true, but it must be
said that acknowledging predecessors was never Scaliger's strongest suit.
Scaliger writes in a ssamboyant style, whereas Vinet's was sober; but the
only place where one is tempted to suspect his sincerity is where Scaliger
says that if he were to attempt a commentary he would only be gleaning
where Vinet had harvested. Finally Scaliger launches into an interesting
though irrelevant defence of Ausonius, Bordeaux, and the College de
Guyenne against the cultural snobbery of Paris and the Gallic nobility.

To Mirmont all this is a smoke screen. He denounces Scaliger as “ce
grand travailleur vaniteux et plat, impudent et hypocrite.''¹³ Grafton does
not go over the top, but speaks of Scaliger's “considerable effrontery'’ in
dedicating it to Vinet.¹4 However strongly we may feel that Scaliger had
in some way stolen a march on Vinet, it is important to keep things in
proportion. Scaliger’s work contained about 250 emendations, of which
not more than fifty can have been taken from Vinet. At the same time it
would be wrong to suggest that Vinet was an indifferent scholar. He too
made many useful emendations, some better than Scaliger’s. But one
cannot deny Scaliger’s greater fecundity, as Mirmont does, or the general-
ly higher quality of his emendations, as Mirmont might have done if he
had been able to recognize it.

We must now turn to the readings themselves. In writing my own text
and commentary on Ausonius I naturally noted all emendations worthy of

¹³ Mirmont, 1:175.
¹⁴ Grafton, 129.
