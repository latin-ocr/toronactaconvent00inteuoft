commenting on Dolet’s oratory, applies to it successively the termsflumi·
na, lumina, fulmina and numina. Aneau commented that Francis 1 would
be an Augustus to Dolet and Dolet a Virgil to Francis. Several, including
Bourbon, Macrin and (curiously) the illustrious Catholic scholar and
controversialist Gentian Hervet (whose epigrams glowingly praise Thomas
More and John Fisher as well as Dolet) gratify his insatiable thirst for
eternal renown. But not all the epigrams on Dolet as a scholar and author
are eulogious. George Buchanan tartly comments that it is small wonder
that Dolet’s poems lack meaning, as their author lacks a mind; and, in
another epigram, that Dolet (as no-one can deny) offers splendid words,
but that that is all he offers. Several mock Dolet’s supposed claim to be
Cicero incarnate: Ducher claimed that he had the soul not of Cicero but
of Villanovanus, whose Ciceronian scholarship he had stolen (De Cloaco et
Dum). Gouvea noted that Cicero's soul had lost its power when spread
through Dolet’s colossal body. And some (Ducher, Gouvea, Scaliger)
criticize his versification.⁶

Dolet was egregious secondly for his personality. To put it mildly, sever-
al contemporaries found him difficult to get along with—and the epigram
is an ideal medium for those with scores to settle. Thus, epigrammatists
focused on his ingratitude‚ his unsociability, his austerity, his treachery, his
conceit.⁷ From the outset of his career as orator and writer he manifested
a tendency to antagonize authority, and this immediately worried even his
friends, many of whom, as we shall see, later distanced themselves from
Dolet by writing hostile epigrams. And Dolet, who had no mean opinion
of himself, had a propensity to belittle others-notably Erasmus, whose
friends (Ducher, Binet . . .) retaliated in epigrams directed at Dolet.

The third interesting thing about Dolet is his views on religion, which
are presented—perhaps caricatured—by epigrammatists. In order to
understand what preoccupied them, it is necessary to examine briefly
Dolet’s religious views. He cavalierly dismissed dogmatic theology, and

⁶ Dolet was sensitive to this crin‘cism and replied to it in a prefatory letter in his
caminum libri quatuor, 1538.

⁷ Even those modern scholars who feel drawn to Dolet have noted these negative
aspect-5. See notably the studies by Claude Lougeon: “Coherences d’Etienne Dolet,''
in 1. D. McFarlane, ed„ Acta Conventus Neo-latini Sammndreani (Binghamton, 1986),
363-693 and the introductions to his editions of Dolet's Le Second Enseu· (Geneve, 1978)
(11) and Cor-respondam (Geneve, 1982) (7) and to his Bibliographie d'Elienne Dolet
(Geneve, 1980) (xx-xxii, xxiv). Among the characteristics which Longeon notes are his
instability, irascibility, conceit, intransigence, selfjustification, naivety‚ vindictiveness,
suspiciousness and recklessness. On his love of same, see especially F. Joukovsky‚ La
gloire dans la possie Francaise et latine du XVIe siecle (Geneve, 1969), 191-92.
