582 ERASMUS'S SUSPICIONS OF ALEANDER

and the anonymous Racha ascn'bed to Aleander. Recently, however, it has
been argued on good grounds that the Racha was not wn‘tten by Aleander
but by the Augustinian Cardinal Giles of Viterbo.⁶⁷ This implies that
Erasmus was wrong in one of his basic assumptions concerning Aleander’s
relationship with Pio.

All these considerations point to the conclusion that Erasmus probably
was wrong throughout in his suspicions concerning the part Aleander
played in Pio's attack. The Aleander of 1530 was less powerful and less
omnipresent than he had grown to be in Erasmus's mind. And although
he considered the recent condemnation of Erasmus by the Faculty of
Theology in Paris the prelude of a deserved general ecclesiastical condem·
nation‚ he probably was not eagerly looking forward to this condemna-
tion, nor did he want personally to promote it.⁶⁸ His last letter to Eras-
mus, written at Regensburg on 4 July 1532, was kind and placative‚ and
patiently prayed him to renounce his earlier insinuations. He offered
Erasmus a reconciliation or rather, in his own eyes, a continuation of their
friendship and for the future he promised letters of a more pleasant
persuasion.⁶⁹

Apparently Aleander did not succeed in convincing Erasmus of his
honest and friendly feelings. The latter continued to consider him the
guiding spirit behind almost every new attack on his work, be it from the
Parisian Theologians⁷⁰ or from Ciceronians such as Scaliger, and, as late
as 1535, Pietro Cursio⁷l or Etienne Dolet.⁷²

The corollary to Aleander's being a less hostile and less involved
adversary is that Pio was a more independent and theologically a more
competent and more dangerous opponent than Erasmus had imagined.

⁶⁸ Cf. Laemmer, 0.c. (above n. 64), p. 94. Aleander suggests, that he had tried to
prevent this development by asking Erasmus eleven years before, that is, in about
1521, “che’l mutasse alcune cose nelli soi scritti et alcune altre mitigasse” (ibid.).

⁶⁹ Cf. Ep. 2679, ll. 42-49‚ and ll. 66-67.

⁷⁰ Cf. Ep. 2565, ll. 3-7. Erasmus’s assumption that Aleander had passed through
Paris on his way to Regensburg was erroneous, cf. Allen, ad loc. On another occasion,
he at least added a reserving “vt suspicor‚” to his assumption, cf. 2587, ll. 9-11.
Aleander himself justifiably denied the Parisian visit in the last letter mentioned, cf.

Ep. 2679, ll. 22-29.
⁷¹ Cf. Ep. 3032, ll. 358-59, and Allen, ad loc. Cf. also Ep. 3052, ll. 29-30.
