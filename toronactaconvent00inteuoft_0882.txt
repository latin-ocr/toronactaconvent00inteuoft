duced scholastic jargon, and tried to translate literally word by word
without caring for correctness, smoothness or elegance. These are the
reasons that prompted Tomas to produce a translation:

que genium sensum, veras rerum notiones, propriam sententiam
interpreu'ones stilo limato, ac leni, verbis selectis, ac idoneis efferen¹⁸

For Tomds, the pursuit of a polished and elegant translation does not
imply, however, that the Aristotelian sense will be misrepresented, a point
on which he insists thus:

hic textus est ipsius met Aristotelis . . . e graeco in latinum versus (vt
Seneca docet) interpraetatus, tam patens, ac lucidus: quam reliqui
obscuri, ac inuoluti.¹⁹

This translation by Mercado was a major contribution to the study of
Aristode, since those available to the scholastics for their commentaries,
such as the ones produced by William of Moerbecke, Vatable and Ar-
gyropoulos, were most deficient. The poor quality of these versions
prompted Tomas to translate the work in order to use it for his own
lectures, and to publish it alongside a commentary at Seville in 1571.
Bearing in mind all the obstacles, besides geographical distances, that
hindered the intellectual exchanges at the time, a strong possibility exists
that Tomas may have not known the Latin translation of the Organum
made by Pacius, published at Frankfurt in 15593 Zabarella's translation and
commentary, published at Venice did not appear until 1578, three years
after Tomas' death.

Conclusion

In sixteenth-century New Spain, some scholastic philosophers were fully

’ aware of the humanistic ideals and attempted to reconcile this tendency

with their own views, adopting some of these ideals and paying heed to
the criticisms formulated by the humanists. Both Alonso de la Vera Cruz
and Tomas de Mercado endeavoured to render their philosophical and
theologica} works in a more refined Latin than most scholastics; they also
cast out from philosophy some treatises and studies that had been criti-
cized by the humanists. Alonso de la Vera Cruz, besides, declares himself
