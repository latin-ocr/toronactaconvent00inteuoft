ipse in Catalogo Scriptorum Illustn'um, olim Dalmatiae Pan-
noniaeque confinium. ld hodie nonnulli, quorum de numero Blon-

Petram pilosam, portulam, et Primontem, ut horum temporum

By referring to Flavio Biondo and to the word “in volgare” for Stridon
Erasmus showed that he was aware of the Quattrocentodiscussion about
the origin of the Italian volgare and the role of Latin or the “sermo
litteratus” in the development of Italian. But at the same time he did not
consider important the question whether Hieronymus could be called an
Italian or not. For the Dutch historian Aurelius, on the other hand, the
argument about the relation between the native language and the patria
was far more important. For the description of the fatherland of Jerome,
Istria, the peninsula in the North of the Adriatic, he used the works of
Pliny the Elder and also of Biondo. Interesting are the observations
Aurelius made about the problem of the vernacular languages. The
language in Istria was apparently related to Italiam but it was not right,
according to him, to call Jerome an Italian for that reason alone. He
compared the situation with that in Holland. The Dutch vernacular was
similar to that of its neighbours, especially the Frisians, the Utrechters,
Flemings, Brabanders and so-called Maaslanders. But still the Dutch
formed their own “nation” and were therefor entitled to their own patria
and name:

Ceterum quod Stridonemjheronimiani ortus consciam in Pannoniae
Dalmatiaeque confinio ipso etiam auctore jheronimo positam legi-
mus, re quoque nostra est nobisque non pamm suffragatur. Siqui-
dem qui Jheronimum Dalmatam non Italum dicunt, meminerint nos
qui Hollandiam utique incolimus Phrisiis et Anthonianis, Belgis et
Bathasiis confines quidem esse, minime tamen eisdem efferri nomi-
nibus aut earundem regionum quod proxime eas commoremur, nos
continuo esse vernaculos ac gentiles.¹²
