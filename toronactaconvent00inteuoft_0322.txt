298 PTOLEMY'S GEOGRAPHIA

regions remoter from the Mediterranean such as Scandinavia‚ where
Ptolemy's knowledge had been very rudimentary. The one oddity which
Donnus Nicolaus does not mention is the inclusion of a map of Palestine
based closely on that of Marin Sanudo already mentioned. This map,
wrongly ascribed by many modern scholars to Pietro Vesconte, was
considered, despite being over 150 years old, as the most instructive and
scientific available. Moreover such as map of biblical and crusader Pales-
tine was needed to supplement Ptolemy.¹⁹

After Columbus’ voyage of discovery, these tabulae modernae were
gradually increased to include America. The Pesaro world map of ca.
15052'o includes the words mundus novus on South America, but a more
specific name was needed. The collaboration of Ringmann and Waldesee-
miiller at St. Die in Alsace resulted in a proposal that the name America,
derived from Amerigo Vespucci, should be adopted for the new conti-
nent.²¹ This is discussed as a possibility in the Cosmographiae introductio
of 1507, which was clearly a joint publication by them.

A curious and somewhat illogical edition of the Geographia was that pub-
lished at Venice in 1511 by Bernardus Sylvanus of Eboli.²2 His idea was not
to supplement Ptolemaic maps with contemporary ones, but actually to
change the figures of latitude and longitude east of the Canaries in Ptolemy's
text. Τὴε reader is first alerted to this in some elegant iambic tn'meters by
Ioannes Aurelius Augurellus (Giovanni Augurelli), beginning:

Si forte primo dentur ingressu tibi,
Hic, lector, obviam ulla, quae statim nova
Inusitataque videantur, vel situ
Priore mota vel figura et ordine
Mutata vel dempta numeris et addita,
. . . ne tu, quaeso, diligentiam
Auctoris aspernare; namque operam is dedit. . . .
