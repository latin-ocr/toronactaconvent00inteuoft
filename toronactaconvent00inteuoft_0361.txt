E. V. GEORGE 337

This time the venue is allegorical, rather than a single literal spot on the
earth. Again cum precedes a pluperfect subjunctive and an active verb
involvi ng Vives as a subject. Matheeussen plausibly takes the opening as an
echo of the first words of Scipio Aemilianus' narrative in the Dream of
Scipio (“Curn in Africam venissem M’. Manilio consuli . . . tribunus ut scitis
militum, nihil mihi fuit potiuS,'’ etc.). The association applies to the first
words of the Genethliacon as well, but in the Aedes the connection is
confirmed by other allusions, notably the echo of the Scipionic remark
about political activity winning divine favor.⁴ Thus the connection of the
Aedes with a kindred philosophica} work at once provides signposts by
which the reader may judge what the drift of the encounter will be.

But there are artistic problems. What does Vives mean when he says he
“came into human society from God'' his commander? Is this intended to
refer to his own birth? That is what the allusion to the Dream of Scipio
implies.⁵ But this implication is either nonsense or humor; it is hard to
tell what we are supposed to envision. Another possible interpretation is
that since he was created by God, he carne to the locum munitissimum, et
cetera. Here, we are to assume that the thoughtful philosopher of politics
knew where he was going, and indeed me contuli sounds like an action per—
formed by deliberate choice. But the nature of his ensuing questions to the
old guardian of the House of Laws presents the picture of a visitor to an
unknown place. In short, we see here by contrast to the Genethliacon an
immediate effort to make the context and the theme more specific by
philosophical allusions, but once again with confusion in portrayal.

Finally, the Somnium accompanying the Commentary on the Dream of
Scipio, a nocturnal excursion to the realm of the god Sleep, where various
events occur more or less directly connected with Vives’ hopes for educa-
tional reform, involving an otherworldly “senate meeting’' which sanctions
humanist renewal of education and a final interview with Cicero, who
provides suitable data for the Spaniard‘s projected commentary. This
narrative opens as follows:

Hesterna nocte, studiosi iuvenes, cum de enarrando vobis Scipionis
somnium cogitarem, Somnus me suam in aedem repente induxit

⁵ “Nihil est . . . illi principi deo, qui omnem mundum regit, quod quidem in terris
siat acceptius quam consilia coetusque hominum iure sociati, quae civitates appellan-
tur. Harum rectores et conservatores hinc profecti huc revertuntur” (Cicero, Somnium
Scipionis 3.5).
