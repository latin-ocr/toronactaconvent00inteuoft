726 DANISH NEo-LATIN EPIC

poem particular weight and significance is the interest of the gods in the
action. This feature is utilized to the fullest in the second epic on the siege
of Copenhagen in 1658, the Hafnia Liberata (l book, 1351 lines) of Henrik
Harder (1642-1683), who later became better known as a writer of
epigrams.⁵ Here, the plot begins with the fury Megaera who is aggravated
at the prevailing peace in the North-a lot of wonderful wars are going on
in the rest of Europe, but in the North peace seems to have come to stay.
She seeks out her sister in the underworld and encourages her to help stir
up a war in the North again. They agree that it would be best to ally with
the Swedes, since the Danes cannot be convinced to use delusion and
cunning, so they proceed to the Swedish court and have their snakes
poison the hearts of the king and his men. The Swedes are thus joined
with the evil of the furies, and the entire subject of the poem, the siege of
Copenhagen, is then presented as a battle between Good and Evil.

Harder has taken this introduction from Claudian's poem In Rufinum
(from around 400 a.d.). Here the fury Allecto is correspondingly irritated
by the peace that exists in the world under Emperor Theodosius. She, too,
becomes allied with her friends in the underworld, where Megaera, also
here one of the leading furies, suggests the young Rufinus as a means to
disturb the peace, and then Rufinus is presented as the quintessence of
everything evil. With this Harder suggests a parallel between Rufinus and
Charles, both of whom are tools of the furies in their attempts to bring
about unrest.

Of course the design of the furies is in vain. Claudian's Stilicho and
Harder's Danish king are both able to conquer the enemy with whom the
furies have confronted them. They fight with the gods on their side. In
Harder’s poem God is offended by the Swedish violation of peace, and
once he has decided to save the besieged city, the Swedish defeat is only
a matter of time.

All these poems are unmistakably on the side of the Danes in the
conflict. A correspondingly propagandistic message is found in Claudian,
who continuously tried to promote the policy of Honorius and his general
Stilicho in his poems. As far as I can see, however, only Harder has made
use of Claudian, in describing the DanishSwedish war as a struggle
between the powers of good and evil. But the distinctions between good
and bad are very clear—cut in all the poems. None of them make the
Swedish king into a tragic hero who is able to arouse the sympathy of the

⁵ Like Borch's Amagria vindicata Harder's Hasnia Liberata was not published until
1693 (see the bibliography), but probably written in the early 1660s.
