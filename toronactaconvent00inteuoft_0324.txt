300 PTOLEMY'S GEOGRAPHIA

of the cartographic texts of the Renaissance. In 1987, at the Paris Interna-
tional Congress of the History of Cartography, Donald L. McGuirk
presented a paper on a Latin palimpsest caused by re-use of a metal plate
on the Ruysch Ptolemy. One passage, as reconstructed by him read VBI
SVT EXTREMICAE DIES MUDI. This must be incorrect, as there is no
word extremicae, and should read ubi sunt extremi cardines mundi. A later
sentence appeared as DICVTVR IRBORET DE EVROPA ET AROPHEI
IN ASIA. These words appear to be translated by him as “disembarked
from Europe and sailed into Asia.” In fact, IRBORET should be
IP(ER)BOREI, with contraction of per, i.e.‚ Hyperborei. As to AROPHEI, it
should be AROPHEI, i.e.‚ Aronphei, described as an insula deserta of the
Arctic in the 1508 Rome edition of Ptolemy.

The other is an introductory sentence in an edition of Pomponius Mela
(Venice, 1482).²⁴ It reads: Novellae etati ad geographiae vmiculatos calles
huma l no viro necessarios flores aspirati vom brimereti ponii. The explorer
and map historiari A. E. Nordenskiffld wrongly thought that the dedica-
tion, votum benemerenti ponitur, was to the man of humanity, humano viro,
and a modern scholar makes no better sense. Certainly the Latin word
order is as tortuous as what are called “the worm-like paths of carto-
graphy’' (geographiae vermiculatos calles). But the dedication is to the first
phrase, novellae aetati, i.e.‚ to the Renaissance. So we may render: “Dedi-
cated‚ as is justly deserved, to the Renaissance, which breathes into
(aspiranti) the man of culture the ssowers needed for the tortuous worm-
tracks of mapwork.'' Such a sentiment epitomises the balance between the
arts and science which that age sought to achieve.

graphia Pomponii (Salamanca, 1498); Campbell (op. cit„ n. 13), 118-19, with translation
by Dr. Lotte Hellinga. The world map is very Ptolemaic.
