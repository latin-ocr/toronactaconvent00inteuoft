express a given idea. Add to this that the Danish version abounds in
pleonasms, and the question poses itself: what has the Latin version got
that is lacking in the Danish one? A series of stylistic refinements, ele—
ments that belong to ornatus in rhetorical handbooks, but also quite a few
matters of content that are either just alluded to in the Danish version or
completely absent.

In the first stanza, there is the elegant ambiguity in the opening word,
mndem. Introducing a funeral text and leading up to an expression of
taedium vitae, it suggests that finally the speaker has reached his goal,
death. However, both the position of the pronoun hunc and the punctua-
tion make it clear that what he has finally achieved is the building of his
funeral chapel. The notion of death as a liberation from the toils of life is
not expressed in the Danish poem. The pun on the two senses of condere
is special to the Latin poem, too. The following lines are rich in allitera-
tion and assonance‚ the s's in 3-4, laetissima letho in 5, which is also an
oxymoron, and especially the i's and s‘s of line 10: Alius haut oculis, sed his
ipsis meis. The “1” of the poem is given prominence by the frequent use of
the first person pronoun, often reinforced with ipse. And the anaphora in
line 7 of ipse for the Saviour and ipsum for the resurrected “1’' suggests a
meeting of two parties that are to a certain degree equal: as Christ is both
man and God‚ Hominemque Deumque, the deceased will be able to see him
with his human but no longer mortal eyes. The Danish version is more
vague. The dead body comes to life again—there is nothing corresponding
to iubebit-and it becomes visible to others, whereas in the Latin version
the whole emphasis is on the resurrected man's active looking at God.

The second stanza of the Latin poem is structured by the anaphora
from line ll to 15 and 17: nunc oblita—non oblita, which creates 3 tension
between the first four lines and their description of vanity and the last six
lines, which dwell upon what does after all remain. The Danish poem also
has anaphora between lines 15 and 17, but nothing to stress the funda-
mental opposition between the two parts of the stanza. And then the Latin
poem is much more explicit concerning the mortal deeds of the speaker
than is the Danish one, the first two distichs of which might apply to any
rich and influential man. What the Latin lines say fits precisely the individ-
ual Jorgen Rosenkrantz. As the youngest of three brothers he had not
inherited a manor house with adjoining land, but scattered property, from
which he had managed, through a lifetime’s exchanges and bargainS, to
create a great estate with fields, forests and lakes, and where he had built
Rosenholm, one of the most splendid castles of the period: jugera terrae,
nemora, lacus, arces. Opes are riches in general, whereas the words regum
domus refer specifically to the fact that during his career he was in charge
