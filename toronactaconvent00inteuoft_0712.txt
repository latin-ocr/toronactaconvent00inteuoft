It is particularly striking that Pufendorf is willing to use jus as “law'' in
this passage since a comparison of his text with the equivalent passage in
Hobbes’s De Cive shows that he is directly replying to Hobbes, asserting
the duty of sociality as the foundation of duties against Hobbes's view of
the right of sels-preservation. Pufendorf, as we have seen, speaks of
sociality as the fundamentalem legem naturalem and of its derivatives as jure
naturali praecepta. Hobbes had spoken of sels-preservation as the Iuris
naturalis fundamentum primum, and had immediately explained that he was
taking jus in a subjective sense; Neque enim Iuris nomine aliud significatur,
quam libertas quam quisque habet facultatibus naturalibus secundum rectam
rationen utendi. Itaque Juris naturalis fundamentum primum est, ut quisque
vitam et membra sua quantum potest tueatur. And Hobbes had continued as
Pufendorf continues (but in the language of rights rather than of duties)‚
that since the right to the means follows the right to an end, everyone has
the n'ght (jus) to use and to do whatever may be for his sels-preservation.

Thus Hobbes’s “persuasive’' definition of jus and lex does not square
with the usage of his period and is explicitly repudiated by Pufendorf.

Further studies along these lines might throw light not only upon the
Latin usage but upon contemporary uses of the vernaculas equivalents.
Such studies of an author’s vocabulary are a valuable clue to the tradition
of thought or even to the ideology within which he is working. In the case
of seventeenth-century Latin political works analysis of contemporary
translations seems particularly valuable.
