564 THE DEmCAToRY LETTER As A GENRE

sculpted by Phidias, but because it was dedicated to Jove.'’ The second
point is the description of the differences in their social standing, the
thought of which almost made Guarino desist from his plan: as happened
to Aeneas, when he met first Creusa, his dead wife, and later Polydorus,
the son of Priam, Guarino became “chilled to the marrow, he could feel
the hair l on his head rise, the voice clot in his throat.”¹³

Whereas the quite early prefaces are all very traditional, the later often
differ from them in tone and structure. Guarino may use the established
scheme jokingly; so, for instance in the dedication of the Philopoemen to
his friend, the lawyer Mazo de’Mazi, where he makes the hero implore
him to be translated as he missed his friend Flaminius, the Latin half of
the pair.¹‘¹ The preface to the Nicocles of Isocrates; this he translated for
Leonello d'Este in 1433, is an example of the way Guarino departs from
the traditional structure. The greater part of the letter is an essay on the
nature of man and the obligations of kings, which leads to the future
responsibilities of Leonello and the speech of Isocrates, where he'can find
valuable advice. Other prefaces, as for instance the dedication to Nicholas
V of the Strabo‚¹5 are built up in a similar manner. However, in the
preface of Nicocles, Guarino abandons the solemn tone at the end, show-
ing his much more informal relations with Leonello. Having said that
Leonello would need a Nestor to counsel him, he then makes Leonello
interrupt him with the ironic comment: “So you think you will serve as a
Nestor,” to which he answers, “No, of course not.’'¹⁶

B. Themes

Another important aspect is how this traditional form was employed by
the author, and what relational structures existed between author, dedica-
tee and text.

A central notion in similar writings is that of humanitas, and this word
has a special function in Guarino’s prefaces: it is the humanitas of Roberto

superiori tempore T. Flaminium aequalem suum et honoris aemulum latinum
fecissem, et socium distraxissem, solum ac destitutum se nequaquam esse paterer.
Audivi hominem et orantem exorare sivi.”
