the audience. Apart from this, St. Patrick was an ideal hero for the stu-
dents, as purity and devoutness had determined his whole life.¹⁹

This applies also to Saint Edmund, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who
appears in at least thirteen plays and who was one of the most attractive
medieval characters, not so much because of his politica] qualities as
because of his personal qualities. With regard to the moral—didactic
purposes of the Jesuits», he was an absolutely ideal subject. Even as a child,
St. Edmund had been a model of selfdiscipline. His austen‘ty towards
himself was balanced by extreme tenderness towards others. He soon won
fame as a public preacher of extraordinary eloquence and at the pope's
bidding, he preached the crusade over a great part of England. In the
light of such a biography, it is no surpn'se that Jesuit dramatists quite
often presented St. Edmund as a model according to which their pupils
could shape their own lives.²⁰

Compared with St. Edmund, Edward the Confessor was a less popular
character on the Jesuit stages. As 1 mentioned above, he is another
positive hero, whose virtues are worthy of imitation. He protected orphans
and widows‚ founded Westminster Abbey, was at peace with everybody
and a welcome party in the drawing up of contracts. His generosity,
justice, kindness and humility are stressed repeatedly. To my mind,
Edward the Confessor was for the Jesuits a personification of their “idea
boni principis”‚ which is illustrated in a drama of the same title, staged in
the college of Mindelheim in 1703.²¹ Thus, plays about Edward were not
only instructive for the students of a college, but they also served as a
mirror of contemporary magistrates or princes.²²

Contrary to Szarota’s opinion, Charles I appeared more than once on
aJesuit stage. In addition to the only play she seems to know, I was able
to find titles of another eight and periochae of another six dramas on the
subject. Considering that Charles Ι died a non-Catholic, it is indeed
surpn'sing how often the subject has been treated. An explanation for its

²⁰ Unfortunately most of the St. Edmund plays are lost. The periochae of the plays
Burghausen, 1629, and Augsburg, 1744, which are kept in the Staatsbibliothek Munich
and the Stadtbibliothek Augsburg respectivcly, give, however, a good idea of the
Jesuits’ presentation of the subject.
