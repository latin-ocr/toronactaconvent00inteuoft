episde, his own biographical sketch of MartiaL and his defense that
became the reigning commentary until 1500.

Beginning in 1491 and onward the commentaries of Calden‘no and
Merula are frequently bound together in various editions. In 1514 an
alphabetical index of places and figures in Martia] appears; a 1515 edition
adds an explanation of words in Martial borrowed from the Greek. In
1518 Pietro Crinito's life of Martial begins to be included. A 1522 Leyden
edition contained most of the material named thus far and also resurrect-
ed some annotations on Martial by Angelo Politian (1454-95) and others.

In 1535 the first expurgated edition of Martia] appeared, the work of
Franciscus Sylvius (Jacques du Bois) (1478-1555), and such chastened texts
came forth regularly from this point onward. The 1579 edition of Hadrian
Junius added two indexes, “Annotations and Corrections,” and “Names of
Those Who Wrote on Martial.” One final sixteenth-century edition that
deserves notice is the 116—page commentary on the Liber Spectaculorum by
Theodore Marcilio (Musambertius) (1584). In 1601 another edition
appeared, this time bound with an assortment of the by-now obligatory
apparatus items and also the 255-page Animadversiones on Martial by
Desiderius Heraldus (1600), a commentary on books 1-12. The Heraldus
is subsequently cited as authoritative while the Marcilio more often only
to be condemned. Scholars at the turn of the seventeenth century, then,
had at their disposal a considerable corpus of scholarship which was as
important as textual advances and which reflected the growing field of the
study of antiquity and the scholars’ tendency to carry old maten'al along
with the new.

Though Schneidewin's and Friedlaender's surveys of seventeenth·
century editions leap from the Gruter (1602) to the Scriverius (1619),
actually, the early part of the seventeenth century marks a high point of
interest in Martial, with at least twenty-six separate editions between 1600
and 1620, and a total of at least 61 editions between 1600 and 1670.
Included among these are commentaries which address themselves to
interpretation, the “poetae mens,” rather than to emendation. Three in
particular stand out in this respect. First is the Hypomnemata or notes on
the Liber Spectaculorum and first four books of the epigrams by Lorenzo
Ramirez de Prado, It appeared only once in Paris, 1607.⁷ Next is the
“gelded” edition with full commentary by the seemingly indefatigable
