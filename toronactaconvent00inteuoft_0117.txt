Rosalie Colie has called our attention to a dominant aspect of Renais-
sance thought and letters: “Rhetorical education, always a model-

following enterprise‚ increasingly stressed stmctures as well as styles to be
imitated in the humane letters—epistles‚ orations, discourses, dialogues,
histon‘es, poems—always discoverable to the enthusiastic new man of
letters by kind.‘’¹ To Colie’s list we must add biography, for biography

On biography as genre, still useful is Donald A. Staufser, English Biography before
1700 (Cambridgez Harvard UniV. Press, 1930; repr. New York, 1964); and there is a
useful collection of documents on biography available at the end of the seventeenth
century in James L. Clisford, ed„ Biography as an Art (New York: Oxford Univ. Press,
1962). Too little known to English Renaissance students are Sem Dresden‚ Destmctuur
van de biographie (Den Haag: Daamen, 1956), and T. A. Dorey, ed„ Latin Biograplzy
(Londonz Routledge 8: K. Paul, 1967).
