his Roman critic, now referred to as Pius ille Carpensis.⁸ After he had
been assured of the amiable personality of this new opponent by one of
his Italian correspondents, Celio Calcagnini‚⁹ he addressed Pio directly
and asked for an explanation of his hostile feelings and statements or
otherwise a disclaimer to the rumours.¹⁰ Apparently he already took it
for granted that Pio was incited by someone else‚¹¹ but it is not clear if
he then already presumed Aleander to be the instigator in question. An
argument against this supposition would be that Erasmus in a contempo-
rary letter made clear that he still obviously valued his long-standing but
precarious friendship with the Italian scholar who had developed into an
influential diplomat and prelate.¹² His following letter referring to Pio,
however, coupled Pio and Aleander without any reservations as being the
leaders of the anti-Erasmian pagan band in Rome: “Romae paganum illud
sodalitium iam pridem fremit in me, ducibus, vt ferunt, Aleandro et
Alberto quondam Principe Carpensi.’'¹³

These suspicions of a close collaboration between the two Italians were
further strengthened by the fact that Pio’s answer to Erasmus's first letter
mentioned above arrived in Basel more or less simultaneously with an
anonymous pamphlet, entitled Racha, the authorship of which Erasmus
immediately ascribed to Aleander.¹⁴ He obviously felt so absolutely sure
of his ground that he openly denounced Aleander as the author of the
Racha in a letter to Pope Clement, complaining about “the two booklets,
one sent to me by Alberto, Prince of Carpi, and another that circulated in
your Holiness's household‚ without author’s name, but for evident stylistic
reasons betraying the Bishop of Brindisi, Jerome Aleander, as the au-
thor.’'¹⁵ From now onwards‚ Erasmus considered the two works, the
anonymous Racka with its presumed author Aleander, and Pio's Epistola

¹⁵ Cf. Ep. 1987, ll. 5-8. For Erasmus this identification of the author is an evident
fact; cf. such statements as in Epp. 2077, ll. 49-50; 2443, 1290. In a similar way in
1532 Erasmus was to undauntedly attribute Scaliger's Oratio, Paris 1531 (Ep. 2564, 2
n.), to Aleander for reasons of “stilus’' and “phrasis”; cf. Epp. 2575, 1. 6; 2581, ll.
