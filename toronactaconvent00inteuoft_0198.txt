174 THE JEPHTHAH TRAGEmEs

Spinoza (1632-1677) was a contemporary and fellow townsman of
Vondel (1587-1679). They must have known each other. We know that
Spinoza took a keen interest in the theater. Studying the Bible was one of
his main intellectual occupations during the 50s and 60s. It is hardly
conceivable that he should never have attended the performance of one
of Vondel's biblical plays. But could he connect them with his own philos-
ophy? Spinoza was a rationalist; in his understanding of man he was heir
to the Aristotelian-Stoic doctrine of the emotions. With their neat op-
positions of affectus, mores and conditiones the comedies of Terence ap—
pealed to his taste. He quotes often from them. Spinoza’s doctrine of the
emotions in Parts 111 and IV of his Etkiae looks like a philosophical coun-
terpart to the tragedies of Racine, who in this respect certainly continued
the conception of drama that was inaugurated in France by Buchanan.
The baroque and popular breakthrough of Vondel's drama must have
remained alien to the philosopher. In the last resort Spinoza was a politi-
cal thinker‚ Vondel was not. Vondel translated his humanist models and
the Bible directly into sentiment and grandiose religious and moral
concepts, into fine poetry and great drama. Spinoza devoted himself to
painstaki ng historical and philological research in the sacred texts in order
to retrieve their “true sense.'’ For these reasons I think that Vondel and
Spinoza remained intellectually foreign to each other. In their time and
work a dissociation has taken place between dramatic conceptualization
and dramatic characterization on the one hand and rational philosophy on
the other, a cleft not yet there in the work of Buchanan.

In the viewpoint of Buchanan's sacerdos as opposed to that ofJephthah
we observe fundamentally the same difference of opinion that exists be-
tween Spinoza and the theologians of his days. The doctrine that obedi·
enee to simple moral law is the essential message of the Bible, and that
this moral law has the same status as the law of nature, occurs in both.
The politica} context in which this law operates is of crucial importance
for both the poet's and the philosopher's point of view, They also share
the conviction that man’s actions and beliefs are ultimately psychologically
determined‚ directly or through the community in which they live.

One might ask whether a concept of tragedy is at all conceivable in the
rigid deterministic system of Spinoza. He does not acknowledge a person-
al God as the ultimate foundation of morality, he does not believe in fate
or chance. Everything that is or happens results from causes with inevita-
ble necessity. “He who goes mad from the bite of a dog is, indeed, to be
