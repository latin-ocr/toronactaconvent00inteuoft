Grotius 's Fame as a Poet

HENK NELLEN AND EDWIN RABBIE

The type of poetry which is commonly referred to as “occasional

poetry'’ was, and is perhaps still even ηοω, considered to be inferi-
or. For many years the appreciation of Pindar’s poems, for instance, was
determined by the prejudice that owing to its occasional nature his poetry
did not by any means measure up to the “truly” immortal works of Greek
literature such as those of Homer and the tragic poets. If this view were
justified, this would be the end of our lecture: for we would not dare to
demand the attention of this eminent audience, not even for as little as
twenty minutes‚ for a poet whose works largely belong to that very catego-
ry of occasional poetry.

In our days Grotius enjoys little fame as a poet3 outside the limited
circles of specialists his present renown is exclusively based on his works
on international law, But in his own times and certainly up to 1800 this
was completely different, as appears from a large number of sources. Dur-
ing his own life collections of the poems he wrote as a young man were
published both in Holland and abroad, and his most famous poems ap-
pear in Dutch and foreign anthologies until the beginning of the nine-
teenth century. As late as 1867 the influential German classicist Lucian
Muller expresses his final judgment of Grotius’s significance as a Neo-Latin
poet as follows: “1 do not hesitate to declare him to be the most noteworthy
of all Latin poets of this country [viz. Holland]'’¹—a staggering statement,
considering that Miiller apparently regarded generally recognised celebn'ties
such asJanus Secundus and Daniel Heinsius as inferior to Grotius.

Grotius wrote the bulk of his Neo-Latin poetry as a young man.² From
