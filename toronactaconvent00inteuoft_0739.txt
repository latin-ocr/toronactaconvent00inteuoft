Ausonius has declared that, ‘Law is the unerring mind of God'. This
was the sentiment that inspired Orpheus-and after him, all the old
poets—to say that Themis and Dike [Right and Justice] were the
judicial assessors ofJove; whence Anarchus has correctly inferred . . .
that a given thing is just because God wills it, rather than that God
wills the thing because it is just. According to the somewhat more
subtle contention of Plutarch, however, the goddesses Right and
Justice are not so much the assessors ofJove, asJove himself is Right
andJusn‘ce, and the most ancient and perfect of all laws. Itis the latter
view that Chrysippus also adopts when he asserts thatJove is the name
given to ‘that force inherent in the constant and eternal laW, which
guides our lives, so to speak‚ and instructs us in our duties.’³

The implication is that God’s will and God’s intellect are really one and
the same, a suggestion which anticipates the philosophy of Spinoza. Thus
the apparent voluntarism in Grotius’s earlier work is only a sapon de parler,
he believes he has transcended the distinction. The later work, in contrast,
retains the intellectualist voluntarism distinction but solves the problem
by affirming both sides of the question. That is, as we have noted, he now
recognizes two independent sources of law, apart from human positive
laws and conventions: nature herself and the will of God.

The introductory chapter of the early work makes his project quite
clear. Quoting Dio, Cicero, Sophocles, and Lactantius in support of the
proposition that international disputes must be resolved by appeal to
customary, unwritten, natural and heavenly laws, he continues:

If those persons [who base their judgment on written laws] do not
read the works of the authors above cited, they ought at least to pay
heed to the words of their own Baldus, who has wisely ruled that in
any controversy arising between claimants of sovereign power the
sole judge is natural reason, the arbiter of good and evil. Other quite
learned authorities uphold this same doctrine. Nor does it differ
greatly from the popular maxim that he who seeks for a statutory
law where natural reason suffices, is lacking in intelligence. There-
fore, it is from some source other than the Corpus of Roman laws
that one must seek to derive that pre-eminent science which is
embodied, according to Cicero, in the treaties, pacts, and agree-
