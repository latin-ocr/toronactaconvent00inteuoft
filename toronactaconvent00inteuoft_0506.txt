482 THE LITURGICAL CONTEXT OF ERASMUS’S HYMNs

similarity less remarkable if we realize that Alcuin and Erasmus are not
versifying the same passage in Revelations 8:3—4 but are adapting the
liturgical version of that passage in the versicles, antiphons, and responses
for matins on Michael's feastday,⁵ in the Mass for Michael’s feastday,⁶
and in the mass of the angels⁷—a passage which was also incorporated in
medieval hymns.⁸

1 wish to consider four of Erasmus’s poems (and four of his best, Ι
might add) which have a direct relation to a liturgical setting.⁹ His hymns
to St. Gregory and St. Ann‚¹⁰ written about 1489 while he was still at the
Steyn monastery dedicated to St. Gregory, are modelled on the hymns of
the breviary and are suitable for the divine office, though we do not know
if they were ever so used. His suite of four angel hymns (to Michael,
Gabriel, Raphael, and all the angels),¹l which were probably written
between 1489 and 1491,12 were composed‚ as Erasmus himself report-

was in the ordinary of the mass (Missale Romanum, 1:200).

⁹ His paean to Mary and his poems on the earthquake and eclipse at the Crucifix-
ion, on the harrowing of hell, and on the shed where Christ was born (Reedijk, nos.‘
19-21, 33) are not closely related to the liturgy‚ either in length, sourceS, or character.
His hymn to St. Genevieve (Reedijk, no. 131), which 1 have discussed in “Erasmus’s
Poem to St. Genevieve: Text, Translafion, and Commentary,'' Miscellanea Moreana:
Essays sor Germain Marc'hadour, Moreana 100, Volume XXVI, eds. Clare M. Murphy,
Henri Gibaud‚ and Mario A. Di Cesare, 481-515‚ is a votive poem, with no direct
relation to the liturgy.

¹⁰ Reedijk, nos. 17 and 22. According to evidence presented by Harry Vredeveld,
the hymn to St. Ann might well have been written about 1498-99. 1 refer to the
accessible edition of Dr. Reedijk, though I have had the beneflt of the new Latin text
and commentary which Harry Vredeveld is preparing for the Toronto Collected Worhs
os Erasmus. For the Lorettan sequence I also rely on the edition of Leon Halkin in
Opera omnia Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami‚ V·1 (Amsterdam and Oxford: North Holland
Publishing Co., 1977), 87-109, taking into account the corrections made by Prof.Josef
Ijsewijn in Humanistica Lovaniensia 31 <1982):217.
