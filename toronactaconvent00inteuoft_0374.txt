350 CAROLUS SIGONIUS

acquisition of knowledge implies a predisposition to accept the concepts
being proposed and explained. Like the orator, then, the writer of dia-
logue must draw upon rhetorical techniques of persuasion. Thus, the
dialogist confronts the contradiction between the reality of ideas that is
the substance of debate and the illusion of expression that characterizes
personage and setting. In attempting to bridge this irreconcilability, Sigonius
acknowledges the importance of verisimilitude and decorum as the means to
create a semblance of truth that, in turn, enhances credibility.⁹

As we recall, the writer of dialogue employs prose rather than verse.
The use of prose links dialogue with oratory; and it also reflects the
customary speech of men, thereby confirming the application of ven'simili-
tude to the writing of this genre. In presenting arguments that lead to
probable conclusions, the dialogist recognizes the need to create a sem-
blance of truth that induces belief. The framework of imaginative scenes
and scripts impedes credibility, but the techniques associated with verisim—
ilitude enable the writer to fabricate a framework compatible with reality:
“hoc autem poeticum eius est potestatis, atque naturae, ut cum adest,
efficiat, ne res, ut est ficta, sic videatur'' (p. 58). The precept of verisimili-
tude is associated with the notion of decorum, or appropriateness of
character portrayal. Like Cicero, in his Orator (21.71), Sigonius sees the
importance of drawing upon the thoughts, speech, and mannerisms
suitable to the respective interlocutor.

Sigonius relates Cicero's principles of propriety to the writing of
dialogue. For Cicero, the rhetor keeps in mind thought and language
appropriate to the speaker and credible to the audience.¹⁰ The
“thought'' to which Cicero refers becomes for Sigonius action and temper—
ament. By identifying thought with action, Sigonius reinforces the mimetic
nature of dialogue and, at the same time, describes his ideas of character
portrayal. His emphasis on the deeds and nature of character recalls
Aristotle's words on appropriateness in his Rhetoric (3.7), which calls for
the use of style corresponding to the emotion and character of its subject.
If man acts according to his situation, then the language of anger must be
used to express outrage, and words of disgust suitably convey impiety or
