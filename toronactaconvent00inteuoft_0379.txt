decorum, Sigonius integrates the methods of argumentation with the
stylistic techniques of rhetoric. But dialogue was also a poetic form; and,
although the dialogist does not center attention on narrative, his use of
mimesis‚ or imaginative imitation of the words of man, qualifies him
nevertheless to assume the place of poet. As Jessenius notes (A2r0-v0),
Sigonius was the first to formulate a definition of dialogue which permit-
ted the refinements and expansions by Speroni and Tasso.¹³ In spite of
these later revisions‚ Sigonius establishes the expectation of a genre which
humanists could shape to the contours of themes and thoughts. The
dialogue, then, was no longer solely characterized by the cut-and-thrust of
dialectical discourse used in the learning of scholastic philosophy or in the
training of disputation. As we have seen, Sigonius unites, and even ex-
pands the limits of, the literatures of fist and palm, and thereby theorizes
a more inclusive genre reflecting the argumentation of philosopher and
the artistry of poet and orator.¹⁴

the Inquisitors in Rome, subsequently published in his Opere, 5 vols. (Venicez Dome-

¹⁴J0n R. Snyder, Writing the Scene ofSpeaking: Theorioe osDialogue in the Late Italian
Renaissance (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1989), chap. 2, has recently comment-
ed on Sigonius’s theory of dialogue. Since his study appeared after the preparation of
my work, 1 could not unfortunately take his views into account. However, as he
describes Sigonius’s adaptation of ancient precepts to an individual, innovative
concept of dialogue, my analysis of Sigonius’s investigation into, and reconstruction of,
an ancient theory of the genre complements Snyder's approach.
