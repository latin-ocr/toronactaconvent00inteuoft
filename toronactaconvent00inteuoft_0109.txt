that grounds it and invites a multi-faceted response from the reader.

“De Servis‘' never wholly falls apart, however. Indeed, as a whole, it
functions as a metaphoric bridge, letting us move, by zigs and zags, from
the preceding section, “De Peregrinatione,” in some sense the ethical core
of Utopia‘s commonwealth,⁷ to the subsequent section on warfare. More
specifically, the initial topic, servitude or bondage, turns us back to issues
central to “De Peregrinatione'’ and beyond that to the dialogue about
crime and punishment in Book 1, while the discourse on treaties, at the
end of “De Servis'’ (the Utopians never make them, althot'ngh they are
endemic in early modern Europe) frames the problematic discourse on
military matters. Less obvious, and more interesting, are the many internal
links, partly etymological, partly associative, and partly conceptual, that
hold this section together or (more accurately) keep it from falling apart
altogether. Implicit in and created by the puns and paradoxes, these links
adumbrate large concerns about bonding and binding and initiate the
heuristic inquiry in which readers are invited to participate.

The first and all-important word-play involves semus itself. There is no
private property in Utopia‚ one person cannot own another, and no one
is born into servitude. So Utopia’s semi are not slaves in our sense of the
word, and the usual translations are misleading in this and other ways.
What we need, instead, is some sense of service shading into servitude, as
in the exchange between Hythlodaeus and Peter Giles over ser-uias and
inser-uias early in Book 1 (54s27-28) or in the double translation of seruus
as “a seruant, a bondeman,” in Cooper’s Thesaurus Linguae.⁸ These
translations, like Robynson's “Bondemen,'' usefully focus on cn'tical
concerns for all of “De Servis”—and for the larger Utopia. Those who are
serui in Utopia are bound (or bind themselves) and de sacto serve the whole
social order. But almost all of the customs treated in this section are
concrete manifestations of bonds or ties that connect parts of the sels, one
person with another, or people with a larger social or cosmic order. At
times such bonds are overtly treated as contracts. They often are contracts,
