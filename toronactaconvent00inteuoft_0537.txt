ed, this is a display rather than an information retrieval system. The texts
are very diverse, include many extracts from poets, and within each
subsection are ordered with a philologian's scruple for chronological
prioriu‘es, so that the reader may see who borrowed what from whom.
Yet, even though Montagnone devotes several columns to rhetoric and
poetic (under the general head of eloquentia), the quotations chosen are
descriptive and prescriptive rather than exemplificatory.

The isolated printing of the medieval Montagnone contrasts sharply
with the activity round another publication which has much of the com-
monplace book, the Margarita poetica of Albrecht von Eyb (1420- 1475)
with its fifteen, often revised and amplified versions between 1472 and
1503. Here we have moved into quite another universe of discourse, m
which the production of texts is to be stimulated by copious verbal varia-
tion. The purpose of the finding mechanism explained in the preface and
worked by an alphabetical list of commonplace-book headings is all about
finding words, rather than matter, “words which can make the letters we
write richer and more elegant in language, especially when we have seen
our way to appropriating to our own kind of letter-writing, by a process of
imitation, the passages from the poets here set out in order” (1472
edition, fol. cxxix). For most of the time Eyb deals specifically with written
rather than with spoken language. The book is loosely related to contem-
porary letter-writing manuals, but derives its values from the practice and,
to some extent, the particular text books in use in fifteenth-century Italian
schools, and transmits to Northem Europe the humanistic rhetoric of
stylistic elegance based on the imitation and quotation of model authors,
which Eyb had learnt during his years in Italy. The most interesting
feature of the work is how he adapts the commonplace—book method to
new preoccupations and old habits, assembling his prose and verse
extracts according to author rather than topic (though they are indexed
according to topic), choosing a preponderance of “good’' classical authors,
but interspersing them with some Biblical quotations of the proverbial
sort, with some recent humanistic writers, but also with some more at
home in the company of the elementary octo auctores morales of the tradi·
tional medieval curriculum. Those eight authors were in fact largely
assemblies of commonplaces in the more banal sense, juxtaposed apho-
risms or similes frozen into unalterable versified sequences and so disfig-
ured as to be incapable of recalling any original text to which they might
once have belonged. How to open up the curriculum to the almost
infinitely extendable, adaptable, manoeuvrable, but barely disciplined
material stored in Eyb’s commonplace book was a question which vexed
many a Northem humanist, and lies at the origin of, for example, Josse
