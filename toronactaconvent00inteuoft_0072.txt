58 LATIN IN 16TH-CENTURY DANISH CULTURE

therefore oral. Writing had, of course, been known for centur-ies and
everybody was aware of its existence—people had been surrounded by
writing since time immemorial: they were familiar with inscriptions on
buildings, church walls and tombstones; they knew that the laws were writ-
ten, and that God’s words existed in a book. But the advent of printing
had given writing a much more important place in people’s lives. Even
without being able to read you were affected by the centn-alized religious
teaching that the Protestant church expounded, book in hand, and in church
you learned by heart the hymns that those who could read sang from their
new Danish-language hymnals. And publishers tried to influence existing oral
traditions by imitating them in printed books, either with the wish to edu—
cate, or in order to gain a profit by selling entertaining works.

For those who could read, pn'nting had done more than just making
knowledge far more accessible. It had also, as emphasized by Elizabeth
Eisenstein,¹⁹ brought a new awareness of certain matters even if they had
been known all along. I shall mention only a few main points.

There was a new awareness that things had to be written in order to be
preserved. Thus it became a fashion among the nobility to collect oral
ballads. A selection of a hundred such ballads was edited in print by
Anders Sorensen Vedel in 1591, with the purpose among other things of
stimulating the repertoire of songs in use. But he also had a nationalistic-
historical purpose: he asserts that these ballads are very old and well worth
comparing with the oral traditions of other nations, and he hopes that
they will provide useful material for the study of Danish grammar, which
has yet to be started.

There was a vivid interest in history with a clear concern for the pres·
ent. Noble ladies compiled genealogies to confirm the age and importance
of their houses, and poets were paid by noble patrons for celebrating their
ancestry in suitable genres. The kings established the office of royal
historiographer in order to have the nation's history described, and they
gave generous rewards to poets who made their or the nation’s history the
subject of their poetry. ’

The existence of many languages and different systems of writing be-
came a recognized fact. Greek and Hebrew had their special letters. With
musical notation, melodies could be written. Roman type was used for the
