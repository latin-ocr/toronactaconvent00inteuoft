88 ΤΗΟΜΑ8 STAPLETON’S USE OF MORE'S ENGLISH WORKS

English Works3 in the words of the running head, it represents “the sum of
the books before concerning the Church.” As a recapitulation should, it
lines up all the points in an orderly way. More himself uses “first . . .
Secondlye . . . Thirdly . . . Fourthly” and again “For the fyrst proofe . . .’'
(p. 816). Stapleton adds the welcome aid of arabic numbers, one row
running up to 9 between page 817 and page 823, and another going from
l to 14 over the four pages 824-27. When he discovers that argument 14
(“the church of Christ is a company mixed of good and badde‚'’ 8261))
repeats argument 10 (8251-1), he strikes off 14, writes 10, 3ηά then re-
sumes numbering 11, 12, 13, reaching 14 at 827C.

Stapleton seems to have found More’s works in defence of the real
presence less relevant to his own day: he puts only a single mark on the
Letter against Frith (835Α), and his only gloss on the much longer Answer
to a Poisoned Book merely repeats what More says in the text: “Tindal capt
of ye englissh heretikes'' <1037G), while in the Treatise to receive the blessed
Body of Our Lord his only remark is a correction of “Mam” to “Luke’'
(marginal gloss at 126812).

The Apology os Sir Thomas More, rich in autobiographical details, mobi-
lizes Stapleton's pen with far greater frequency. At 849D he spotted four·
teen lines which he had bypassed at 224A in book 3, chapter 10, of the
Dialogue Concerning Heresies. In The Apology More refers us to his earlier
book and repeats the passage verbatim. Stapleton adds a vertical bar to
the printer’s quotation signs. The passage is famous, the more so no
doubt because it occurs in the two most read of More's English works of
controversy: to emend Tyndale’s New Testament would mean, says More,
to sew up every hole in a net and to eat, after scraping it, the bread
poisoned by your enemy. But in Stapleton's notes on The Apology the
theologian is not swallowed by the biographer: in a six-line note beginning
with “Yet'' (863G) and partly illegible because a later binding has eaten off
part of the margin, Stapleton enlists the authority of St. Thomas, of St.
Denys, and “of all the divines now'’ in favor of an opinion not shared by
More, namely “that the dampned spyrites haue all theyr naturall gyftes as
whole and as parfytte‚ as they hadde before theyr fall.” The printed gloss
“In my Lorde Cardinal wolses daies’' (8923) may have prompted Staple-
ton to write the more specific remark: “Wolse cause of pompous apparell
in the clergy.” More's text merely alludes to Wolsey's “yeares not longe
paste,’' marred by “the pryde and ouer sight of some few’' priests. At
901D, coming across the name of George Iay (Joye), which he had already
singled out in the preface to the Confutation, Stapleton underlines “now
for all that wedded in Antwarpe.'' In the last chapter, where More justifies
his “fansies and sportes 8c mery tales'' through Horace’s dictum “a man
