566 THE DEDICATORY LETTER As A GENRE

of the Pelopidas and Marcellus was again a poor token of his gratitude.²³
The gratia-munificentia relation coexists with other types of relations:
elsewhere Guarino uses emotional terms like caritas, amor and benevolentia
about his relationship to both Barbaro and Leonello, and the feelings are
seemingly reciprocal.

On the level of contents‚ it also seems to have beeri important to
establish links between the text and its recipient. Guarino often praises the
eruditiori and prudence of his dedicatees. Erudition was not a purpose in
itself‚ though one sometimes has that impression. It was rather the means
to obtain prudence and experience, qualities which were essential for
anyone engaging in public affairs‚²⁴¹ and it furthered human qualities like
leniency and clemency. Also Plutarch is erudite, very much so, and Gua-
rino several times emphasizes the prudentia of Plutarch's beroea thereby
establishing the connection with the dedicatees by means of analogy. The
wise, old statesman‚ general and admiral, Carlo Zeno, is presented with his
Athenian counterpart, Themistocles, the prudentia of the one mirroring
that of the other;²⁵ and when Barbaro began his term as podest& in
Vincenza, he could take advice from Phocion, who was known as a pru-
dent counsellor both in war and peace.²⁶

Only once do we have a formal exposition of the utility of history, and
this is in the preface to the Pelopidas and Marcellus; elsewhere the transla-
tions, the study of literature and the whole complex of studia humanitatis
are described iri words that recall Cicero‘s praises of the effect of rhetoric.
Guarino often hopes that his translation will please people, using the word

²³ No. 706: “Cogitanti mihi, Leonelle princeps, et priora illa et recentiora haec
tuae iri me magnificentiae merita, quibus ut quasi tuae caritatis et benivolentiae
cumulum adiungeres .. . , est enim grave, homini verecundo praesertim, gratiam
referre non posse, . . .’'

²¹¹ No. 706, the preface to the Pelopidas and Marcellus: “Praeterea qui privati sunt
vel ipsa antiquitatis peritia, quae non parva prudentiae pars est, ad magistratus et
imperia digniores evandunt.‘'

²⁵ No. 66: “Iri hoc ipsum vitae genus [i.e., a scholar's life] te pro summa prudentia
tua non sine probabili causa venisse certo scio, cum post illustrissimas res tuas terra
marique gestas, quibus et pacis et belli magister optimus evaseras, . . .'’ about Carlo
Zeno, and “Iri ea vero lectitanda mirifice te oblectaturum esse confido, cum aliis de
causis tum quia summae prudentiae virum, maximae auctoritatis civem, eximiae
integritatis praetorem, incredibilis prudentiae consiliarium, rei denique militaris
instructissimum imperatorem aspicies,’'about Themistocles.

²⁶ No. 651: “Tibi itaque Phocionem adduco, fidelem profecto et sapientem pacis
atque belli consiliarium, in quibus quidem artibus adeo, uti nosti, mirifice excelluit, ut
nescias fortissimine ducis et strenui militis an prudentissimi senatoris et boni oratoris
laudem magis illi tribuas.'’
