Jovcss Monam: ειΜΜοΝε 693

The Hypomnemata is a delight to read forits vigorous style and individu-
al response to the epigrams. Ramirez's uncovering of intricate combina-
tions of figures and ornaments in his rhetorical analysis bears witness to
the technical skill of Martial. As one of the few to grapple with the very
real issue of obscenity in the epigrams, a topic at last receiving attention
today, Ramirez offers readings of a number of these difficult poems.¹⁴ At
one point he digresses to defend himself: “1 love this poet for many
reasons, but above all because he is the most assiduous master of refine-
ment (urbanitatis). 1 hate the supercilious who think him obscene. May 1
perish if anything obscene offends in him. For he writes everything to one
end: that he may with a laugh and mocking gesture (subsannatione) deter
us from vices and coarseness of manners.‘'¹⁵ In these respects Ramirez’s
commentary serves Martial well.

In contrast to Ramirez, Matthias Rader, of course, purged all of the
obscene epigrams from his edition. This German Jesuit‚ born in 1561, is
often better remembered today as the object of two vicious attacks by
John Donne, first in an epigram and then in an anti31esuit tract, [gnatius
his Conclave (1611).¹⁶ The Jesuits were not the first to purge Martial, but
Donne viewed such tampering with texts as aJesuit effort to manipulate
learning. Rader’s commentary belies such charges and reveals a man of
vast erudition and little rancor toward other scholars. Of the three com-
mentaries it is the most learned and the longest, treating all fifteen books
of epigrams. ⁷

Rader discloses his threefold plan for the commentary in the preface:
to reach the mind of the poet (“poetae mentem’'), that is, his innermost
thoughts; to illustrate them with parallel passages (“geminis dictis”) from
various others; and to fortify his readings with other evidence.¹⁷ He has
annotated Martial, he states, as Servius and Donatus had for Vergil, as
Acron and Porphyrion had for Horace, and the anonymous commentator
for Juvenal. With the subject of his commentary as no less serious or
