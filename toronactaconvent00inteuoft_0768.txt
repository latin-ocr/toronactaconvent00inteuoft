742 CHRISTIAN EPIC THEORY AND PRACTICE

It occurred to Mutius while riding his horse to Rimini that in the life of
Christ a poet could find a wealth of suitable subject material.⁸ The idea
of a poem which concentrated on Chn‘st’s descent into hell especially ap-
pealed to him: tollebat animum ea cogitatio ac sublimem rapiebat et dulcedine
quadam novitatis pertentabat.

In the second preface Mutius abandons his polemic against pagan
poetry and turns instead to defending biblical poetry against its detractors
(excipient haec quidam cum risu, certo scio, et contemnent). One reason, writes
Mutius, that contemporary poets give for not writing Christian poetry is a
stylistic one. Christ is a name, they say, which is inimicable to the Muses
(afonte sororum ut aiunt aversum existimant). Mutius points out that there is
nothing about the sound of the name of Christ itself which makes it unfit
for verse. In fact, Virgil, Statim, and Silius Italicus all use the word crista
(plume) in their poetry-and the word crista is very close to Christus.

A second objection to biblical poetry is that its themes are too lofty and
exceed the power of the poet to describe (quod poeticam facultatem excedere
sortasse arbitrantur). This is an objection which Mutius takes more seriously:
negare non ausim eam esse divinarum rerum vim atque dignitatem ut nullo stilo
assequi possimus. Nonetheless, Mutius continues, it should be observed that
the pagan poets dealt with lofty and divine subjects such as the triune
nature of divinity (the three deities, Neptune,Jove, and Pluto, who ruled
the three distinctive realms of the universe are a sort of pagan tn’nity,
according to Mutius). Even such a profound mystery as transubstantiation
finds parallels in pagan poetry. Virgil writes of wine turning into “foul
blood‘’ (fusaque in obscoenum se vertere vina cruorem). Certainly Ovid’s
Metamorphoses contain miracles just as incredible as the transformation of
bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ.

But even if the poet were to leave such divinely mysterious subjects
alone, certainly the life of Christ on earth is not too lofty to consider in
verse, especially those parts of his life in which he is clearly human.
Christ’s childhood, for instance, presents a wealth of appropriate maten'al
for the poet. And yet, complains Mutius, “our Muses despise” the subject
(pueritiam Christi musae nostrae despiciunt.) They prefer to tell of Romulus‘s
and Remus’s upbringing or the stories of the youthful Achilles or As-
canius.

⁸ For biblical texts treating of the descent into hell, see, among others, 1 Peter 3:19
and 4:6. The most extensive treatment in antiquity was the apocryphal Gospel of
Nicodemus (see the useful discussion in C. Reedijk, The Poems ⁰s Desiderius Emsmus

[Leiden, 1956]‚ 189).
