MARIANNE ALENIUS 187

Among the 23 new learned women in Frederik Christian Schonau,
there are only three who are familiar with Latin. Of these, Martha Lous,
as already mentioned, also knew Greek and Hebrew. In the last Danish
gynaeceum, H. J. Birch’s, Latin is no longer the criterion. However, it is
clearly characteristic that the most learned among them, Charlotta Doro-
thea Biehl, recalls in her old age how she dreamed, as a five-year-old, of
being able to learn Latin.

Conclusion

Thus, we can conclude the following: In Scandinavia 150 learned women
were known from the period between 1500 and 1800. The majority of
these were Danish. A few were Norwegian and Swedish. We know none
from Iceland or Finland.

The notion of learning according to which they were evaluated was not
unambiguous. According to the most narrow definition, knowledge of
Latin was required. 1f we adhere to such a definition, there can hardly
have been more than 25 or 30 out of the 160 who could be called learned.
The men who collected information on them and described them, howev-
er, seem to have thought that there were other qualities than Latin that
should count. Literature in the vernacular, for example, was gradually
becoming more and more esteemed dun‘ng this period. The attitude of
the women themselves to Latin seems to have been that they would like to
learn it, but were rarely given the opportunity.

However, if they did know Latin, there was a greater demand for them
to utilize this knowledge for the purpose of enlightenment in the national
language than there was for writing their own works in Latin, even though
it is clear, where most of them are concerned, that they were quite compe-
tent when it came to writing Neo-Latin.
