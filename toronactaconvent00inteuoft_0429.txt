shows a different pattern, suggestive of a status somewhere between the
play conceived primarily as literary artefact and the play priman'ly as
performance. The text opens with the traditional letter of dedication,
addressed both to the dedicatee (explicitly) and (clearly also) to the
reader: it deals with the general issue of a modern writing Terentian
comedy, with his choice of subject-matter, and with various more technical
aspects of his adaptation of the genre. Here the writer is Gulielmus
Gnapheus, addressing his friend Ioannes Sartorius and beyond him the
literary public; in the prologue, which follows in the text after the dramatis
personae, the author again embarks on introduction and captatio, but now
he has become ‘the dramatist,’ addressing not a reading public but an
audience, through the medium of one of his characters on stage. The
speech is more purely Terentian in subject-matter than are Reuchlin’s
prologues; it alludes to the paraphernalia of a real theatre—in apparatu
scenico tituli—and affects to detect in one of the audience embarrassment
at the description of his literary misdemeanours. Yet the appearance is, at
least in part, illusory. This prologue is not the transcription of a perfor-
mance, but is conceived primarily as a written text designed to evoke the
idea of performance. While Reuchlin wrote his plays for performance and
afterwards did not (apparently) even supervise their publication himself,
in his preface Gnapheus writes more tentatively: “Quod si iuuet comoe-
diam hanc public spectandam exhibere. . . .” If we can take this at face
value, no production had taken place at the time of publication, but the
play, although originating as a written, literary text, had been composed
with at least half an eye to performance; publication may in fact have been
a direct herald to production. Acolastus, then, is as it were suspended
between the play as production and the play as a printed book, but the
latter seems to be uppermost in Gnapheus' mind.

The emphasis seems to have been otherwise with the plays of this genre
which followed, for stimulating which the success of Acolastus was largely
responsible. Though Gnapheus was a schoolmaster, he wn'tes first and
foremost for the republic of letters; his successors, themselves too mostly
schoolmasters, were clearly not averse to the praises of the literary world,
but on the whole seem to have thought first of reading and especially
producing the plays as a suitable occupatiori for their classes. In a note ad
lectorem prefaced to Haustus, Macropedius apologises for the large number
of parts in the play, a device necessary, he says, to give a role to a greater
number of boys. The shape of the play when published is dictated by the

circumstances of performance.³
