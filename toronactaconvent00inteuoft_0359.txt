FancifitlJourneys in Vives' Early Writings

E.V. GEORGE

Among Juan Luis Vives’ experiments in various literary forms prior
to 1522, there is a striking series of three instances of a narrative
type which I shall call the fanciful journey, defining it as a visit to a place
inaccessible to Vives the traveler on the literal geographical map of his
world and in his own era. The works in question are the Genethliacon Iesu
Christi (from the “Kalends ofJanuary,” probably no later than January,
1519, our style); the Aedes Legum (April, 1519); and the Somnium com-
posed as a satirical preface to the 1520 Somnium et Vigilia in Somnium
Scipionis (March, 1520).¹ The following survey of selected aspects of these
journeys is offered as possible evidence of stylistic development on Vives'
part.

We start with a look at how Vives visualizes the entrance into the
worlds of the three journeys. First, the Genethliacon Iesu Christi, in which
Vives travels across the Mediterranean from Valencia to palestine, arriving

Matheeussen in J. L. Vives: Early Writings, ed. C. Matheeussen, C. Fantazzi, and E.
George (Leidenz E. J. Brill, 1987), xv-xx. The Genethliacon was presented to Jean
Briard of Ath on the “Kalends ofJanuary,’‘ further unspecified. As Briard died on 8
January 1520, and the Genethliacon dedication makes no mention of his death, this
date is “an all but certain ter-minus ante quem” for the actual publication of the
opuscula varia volume (Matheeussen, p. xix). For the “Kalends” to have been as late
as January 1520 itself (in our dating style) would also be highly unlikely. Matheeussen
(op. cit„ p. xviii.) accepts April 1519 as a highly probable date for the Aedes. The
Somnium preceding the Dream os Scipio commentary appeared in March 1520. See P.
S. Allen‚ ed., Opus Epi-stolarum Da. Erasmi Roterodami, vol. 4 (Oxfordz Oxford Univ.
Press, 1922), ep. 1106, line 103 and note. It was augmented and revised in 1521
(Basel, Froben). A fourth work dedioeted 1 April 1519, the Anima senis, resembles in
some ways the three considered here but does not involve a journey.
