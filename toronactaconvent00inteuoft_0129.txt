Erasmus on the Use and Abuse ofMetaphor

LAUREL CARRINGTON

Although my paper‘s title points to Erasmus’s concerns about meta-

phor, my actual subject draws on a series of issues of which this is
only a part. To begin with, the place of metaphor in the classical discipline
of rhetoric is extremely important, as is Erasmus's complex relationship to
that tradition. Erasmus’s use of metaphor in his own writing, as well as his
explicit statements about metaphor, likewise bear upon my immediate
concern. Above all, however, 1 am interested in showing how the question
of metaphor can throw light on Erasmus’s work and on the many areas in
which Erasmus was involved with using and writing about language.

For when we look at Erasmus, we see a man who wore many hats:
educator, biblical scholar, writer, and religious reformer. All of his roles
reveal him as deeply concerned with the use and power of language, yet
because the tasks that occupied him were so varied, often the attitudes he
professed toward language seem to be at odds with one another. Erasmus
the writer embraced an approach to prose writing that can only be de-
scribed as that of the virtuoso practitioner, as we detect in his opening to
the De Copia: “Ut non est aliud vel admirabilius, vel magnificentius quam
oratio, divite quadam sententiarum verborumque copia, aurei fluminis
instar, exuberans. . . .”¹ Works such as De Copia, Parabolae, and De Conscri-
bendis Epistolis combine a lively admiration for fine writing with a work-
manlike concern for the tools needed to write well. As a biblical scholar,
Erasmus showed another kind of concern with language, focusing on the
priority of purifying the text of Scripture in order to base interpretation
on biblical language that was accurate and capable of being read in its
