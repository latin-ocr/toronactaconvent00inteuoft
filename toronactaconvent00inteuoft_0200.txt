176 THE JEPHTHAH TRAGEDIES

soul,’' and died in the middle of the hymn.²⁰ Spinoza had come to reject
as superstitio the saith Juda el Fido had newly embraced, but at the same
time he felt admiration and pity for the victjm of this faith and also for the
collective fate of the Jewish people.²¹ 1 think that something like this is at
the back of Buchanan’s ideas. If so, this illustrates that Spinoza’s thinking is
not the philosopher’s stone suddenly fallen from heaven in the seventeenth
century. It is a link in a long chain of moral and religious thought. The
Greek conception of tragedy has given this thought a new dimension.

Allow me in conclusion to quote a passage from Spinoza expressing
some disdain for scenic plays: “Anyone who has read the stories of Holy
Writ, but has not paid attention to the lesson they are consigned to
convey or mended his ways, might as well have read the Koran or the
poetic dramas (poetarum fabulas scenicas).”²² Was Vondel here in Spi-
noza‘s mind? Vondel is a post-humanist poet, who in breaking away from
the neo-classica} drama which he imitates stands almost at the threshold of
the romantic age. Spinoza holds political and religious beliefs which are
far ahead of his times. Both are deeply indebted to the long traditions of
antiquity and humanism. But they are irrevocably separated from each
other in thinking and writing.
