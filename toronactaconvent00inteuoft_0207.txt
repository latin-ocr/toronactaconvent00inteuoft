characteristic that the literature that can teach you something and that
helps you to become a better person is written in Latin. But precisely
Latin lies outside the scope of the majority of women. Thus, she notes
that it is not least in order to get women to see what they are missing out
on without Latin that she translates such a morally instructive author as
Seneca. She herself writes freely in Latin when she is wn'ting to men.¹²
For Birgitte Thott, Latin was useful when it came to important correspon-
dence with men, but more than that it was a means of gaining access to
the knowledge which they possessed. After that she regarded it as her duty
to pass on what she had learned to other women in Danish.

Not all learned women published anything. Quite frequently the
gynaecea provide no more information about a given woman than her
name, possibly her marital status and a remark to the effect that she was
considered to be very learned during her lifetime. It is difficult to deter-
mine what sort of learning lay hidden behind such remarks. ln one single
instance remarks on such learnedness have been preserved. These concern
the now totally forgotten Martha Lous who had studied during her entire
youth and at the age of seventeen was given the offer of being examined
by a professor. At the examination she received a wn'tten recommendation
in German which she translated into Latin herself. In it we find a record
of her accomplishments in Latin, Greek, HebreW, theology, history,
geography, philosophy, etc.

About Martha Lous, Schonau tells us (p. 979) that

sie einen guten Lateinischen Stilum schreibet, in Theologia Cathe-
tica‚ und Acroamatica, wie auch Historia Biblia wohl bewandert ist,
Autores Latinos sehr wohl verstehet, das ganze neue Testament in
Griechischer Sprache gelesen‚ auch in der Grundsprache des alten
Testaments sich etwas gefibt hat, und gute wissenschaft in der
Hebrfiischen Grammatic besitzt, ferner die Fragen aus einem Com-
pendio Historiae Universalis und der Geographie sehr wohl beant·
worten kan‚ ja auch mehr weiss, als in einem Compendio stehet;
Dann auch . . .

—and it continues here concerning her philosophical studies. Just how
many Martha Lous’s are hidden behind the long list of names in general
we do not know.

¹² Only two letters in Latin from Birgitte Thott have been preserved (cf. note 11).
Her Latin correspondence, however, was still known at the close of the 18th century.
