friends. As a collector he owned a vast library, as well as a fine display of
ancient statues and monuments (many taken from the Villa of Marius
which he uncovered at Frascati); his art collection contained works by
Titian, Van'Dyck, Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, and Michaelangelo. He was
respected in the world of letters, succeeding Bossuet to the French
Academy and holding honorary membership in both the Academie Royale
des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres and the Academie Royale des Sciences.³

The inspiration for his anti-Epicurean poem casne as a result of a
conversation he held with Pierre Bayle on his return from Poland in 1697.
To each of Polignac‘s observations on the subject of religion Bayle replied
with a quotation from Lucretius; and the popularity of the Latin poet
during the period is attested by the fact that, while between 1580 and
1650 there had appeared only two editions of the De Rerum Natura,
between 1650 and 1708 there appeared six new editions and two transla-
tions in France alone.⁴ If Lucretius could thus furnish weapons for the
sceptics, then he must be disarmed. The task was to occupy Polignac for
the rest of his life, and the result was the Anti-Lucretius sive de Deo et
Natum, nine books of Latin hexameters totalling more than 12,000 lines.
Polignac did not himself see the poem published; at his death in 1741 the
manuscripts were taken in hand by his friends the Abbe de Rothelin and
the Abbe Cerati, rector of the University of Pisa, and finally put through
the press by Le Beau, Professor of Eloquence at the University of Paris,
who composed the Preface for the first edition of 1747.⁵ But the poem
had long circulated in manuscript and was much in vogue in the salons
and at the Court (portions were translated for Louis XIV by the Duke of
Bourgogne); during its composition Polignac received encouragement and
advice from such people as Malebranche and Boileau, and the poem was
