548 GRoran’s FAME As A ΡοΕΤ

attitude towards Theodorus Beza; in an epicedium dating from 1606,²⁸
thirty-seven years earlier, Grotius had literally praised him to the skies, but
later Beza‘s intransigent Calvinism had induced him to form a much more
negative judgment.

Thus, Grotius’s poetry, especially during his youth, constitutes a com-
plement to his other writings which is indispensable for a proper under-
standing of the author, his life, his connections and his intellectual devel-
opment. But, unfortunately, this importance goes hand in hand with the
inaccessibility of Grotius's poetry for the modern reader. The often
convoluted Latin, in the tradition of the Silver Epic, the impenetrable
mythological apparatus, the frequent allusions to loci in classical Latin
poetry, the importance of the historical details of the situation in which
the poem has been written, all these obstacles which the modern reader
encounters on the road to a proper understanding of this great poet
necessitate a modern edition of Grotius’s poetry with an elaborate com-
mentary. As stated above, such editions further the understanding of
Grotius’s life and works. But above all we believe that his poetry itself,
owing to its intrinsic qualities, amply justifies such an undertaking.
