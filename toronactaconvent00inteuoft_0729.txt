he becomes an object of satiric mockery in literature and art. Deriving
from Ovid‘s Heroides IX, this topos is called “Hercules and Omphale.”⁸ It
concerns the period when the hero was sold as a slave for three years to
the queen of Lydia as punishment for killing his friend Iphitus dun’ng a
spell of madness. Since Omphale found the muscular Hercules to her
liking, she invited him to become her lover and soon enslaved him emo-
tionally as well as physically. But the ancients believed that passionate
love—perhaps suitable for women—actually effeminizes a man. Because this
negative attitude toward passion appealed to moralizing Christian human-
ist scholars and to the emblemafists among them, the affair between
Hercules and Omphale became an obvious opportunity for satire on the
foolishness of military men in love. Enslaved by his passion for the Lydian
queen, the hero must now amuse her by dressing in female clothing and
by learning the art of spinning, instead of practicing his usual warlike
activities. She, in turn, often wears his lion skin and brandishes his club in
painted renditions of the scene.⁹

Lukas Cranach’s 1537 painting of the topos (fig. 3) includes both a
Latin moral verse and a description of a bearded but effeminized Hercules
in Omphale's court. Both verse and picture are designed to provoke
laughter at the hero so degraded by love. As Sir Philip Sidney explains in
his Defense os Poe-sie, “So in Hercules, painted with his great beard, and
furious countenaunce, in a womans attyre‚ spinning, at Omphales com-
maundement: for the representing of so straunge a power in Love,
procures delight‚ and the scornefulnesse of the action, stirreth laugh-
ter.'‘¹⁰ Cranach’s satin'c epigram reads as follows:

HERCULEIS manibus dant Lydae pensa puellae

Imperium dominae fert deus ille suae.
Sic capit ingentis animos damnosa voluptas
Fortiaque enervat pectora mollis amor.

The Lydian girls give tasks to the hands of Hercules;
He submits to the rule of his mistresses.

passionate lovers in Antony and Cleopatra when Cleopatra exults: “Ere the ninth hour,
1 drunk him to his bedy Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilstl 1 wore his
sword Phillippan” (11.v.21-23).
