206 MULCASTER AND MERCURIALE

and quite in keeping with Mulcaster’s style which throughout Positions now
and then plays with intentionally amusing digressions to give relief to
purely technical discussion. Likewise‚ his alliterations continue
sound-patterns used all the way through Positions: examples are “deflux-
ions and distillings'' (combini ng definition and alliteration for Mercuriale's
simple “defluxiones’'), “cooleth the flesh 8c furthereth not the feeding''
(for “carnem refrigerat, nec alimenti reddit capaciorem,” itself a chiastic
alliteration), and “as the fore warning of some forreine disease” (for
“quibus morbus forinsecus immineat'’).

Overall‚ as this analysis of chapter 21 of Positions shows, and as a close
reading of other chapters would also demonstrate, Mulcaster condenses
his source by omitting debate and authorities. He adds to Mercuriale a
few historical examples and images, and he transforms the fairly straight-
forward medical jargon of the De arte gymnastica into his own “close'’ style
of writing. These chapters on sports may be the least successful in Posi-
tiom-—the most heavily studded with authorities most of whom are bor-
rowed directly from Mercuriale, the least concerned with students and
parents, the most lacking in personal observation and experience. Yet they
do show us Mulcaster attempting to work in as full a manner as he could
with a subject seemingly unfamiliar to him, and the chapters on dancing,
archery, ball games, and the training master do show a concern with
contemporary practice which is not found in the De arte gymnastica of
Girolamo Mercuriale.

The fact that Mulcaster relied on Mercuriale as he does and the manner
in which he modifies his source are directly related to the ideological
direction of his argument. Richard Mulcaster is one of the three most
important writers in sixteenth-century English pedagogy; the other two are
Sir Thomas Elyot and Roger Ascham. Unlike his two predecessors, howev-
er, Mulcaster is not specifically concerned with the education of the
gentleman. His program considers all social groups. In a sense, his recom-
mendations reflect an important shift in late sixteenth-century schooling.
By the 1580s the schools of England had been rapidly expanding in both
size and social composition. The education of the gentleman, formerly
undertaken under the guidance of a tutor in a great house, was still in
practice, but had begun to break down—Philip Sidney and Fulke Greville‚
for instance, both very well born, studied under Thomas Ashton at
Shrewsbury. By the 1580s, the programs of Elyot and Ascham had become
obsolete. Not that they disappeared as nostalgic ideals, but they corre-
sponded hardly at all with contemporary practice in the schools. Mulcas-
ter, for instance, taught 250 boys with the help of only three ushers or
assistant masters. Ashton taught 450 with as little manpower. It was a
