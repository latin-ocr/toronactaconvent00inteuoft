have, in effect, enslaved or imprisoned themselves by committing some
heinous crime; persons from other countries who have been condemned
to death there for some offense and are either purchased cheaply by
Utopian merchants or (more frequently) acquired gratis; and “hard-
working and poverty—stricken drudge[s] of another country” who voluntari-
ly choose servitude or service in Utopia‚ where they are treated more
humanely than they were in their own country, to which they are, in any
case, free to return-but rarely do (185s31-33).

We are free to search for explanations3 in fact, the initial marginal gloss
encourages us to compare and contrast practices and policies elsewhere
(185s16-17). We can appeal to other texts, too; the servitude of persons
in the second group, in particular, seems to reflect Augustine’s idea of the
origin of bondage: “Sinne therefore is the mother of seruitude, and first
cause of man subiection to man.”¹¹ Failing to internalize and act upon
Utopia’s calculus of pleasure and virtue, these people have made them—
selves what Augustine would have called the servants of sin,¹² and their
external situation—they are loaded with chains, albeit ones made of gold
(in almost all other countries a source of pride) and dealt with most
severely—literalizes their internal condition, from Utopia’s perspective‚ and
punishes what Hythlodaeus sometimes calls crime, sometimes an offense
or sin (19οΧ 14, 29). Moreover, the insistent link between crimes sin and
hard work suggests another Augustinian and biblical echo and reflects a
certain rough justice: servitude may bring about reformation. If the serui
work hard enough, that is, and are sorrier for their offense than for their
punishment, their servitude may be lightened or remitted.

Yet Raphael's discourse subverts some part of this subtext. Augustine
concluded his discussion of bondage by charging servants to obey their
masters, no matter how unjust their situation seemed, urging them to
accept a status quo until “iniquity be ouerpassed, and all mans power and
principality disannuled, and God onely be all in all.”¹³ By contrast,
Utopia offers the poor a paradoxical alternative that implicitly challenges
part of Augustine's compromise and sharpens our sense of the gross
injustice in Europe, while mischievously confusing our sense of service and

fathers were noble or rich enough, that is.
