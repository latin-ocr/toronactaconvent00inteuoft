tion was, in fact, quite in accordance with the ancient concept of the visual
art as mimesis. What was expected from the artist in ancient Greece or
Rome was precisely his creation of a sense-deceiving illusion of that
illusion to the senses which made up the world of things in contrast to the
geometrical order of higher reality. Through the imitation of existing
things, “things that are or could be,’' as Vitruvius has it, the work of art
came into existence itself, but as an imitative object rather than an artistic
creation. Hence the artist was regarded as a craftsman who made artifacts.
In the Middle Ages the view upon the arts and artists, broadly speaking,
remained the same. The work of art was considered to be, more or less,
an enlargement or a supplement to divine creation, and the artist to be
working as the obedient tool of its creator, God.

At the end of the fourteenth century, finally, the word imitare reoccurs
in connexion with the visual arts‚ this time in a strictly humanistic text. In
his lives of Giotto and his pupils, Alberti’s elder fellow-townsman, Filippo
Villani, relates about one of these that he was called the monkey of
nature, natura simia, from his cleverness at imitation.¹² And from the
following passage we learn that this meant a detailed rendering of the
human figure in its outward appearance, its skin, hair, and so on. It
should be interposed, incidentally‚ that in his biographies of the Floren-
tine painters Villani lent heavily upon Pliny the Elder in structure and style
as well as in content.

But it was certainly not that kind of surface illusion Alberti wanted the
artist to produce. When his painter was enjoined only to occupy himself
with things seen, it was not in order to bewilder the senses of the behold-
er by confronting him with a mere shadow of the shadowy reality of the
world of things; his task was instead to challenge the rational judgment of
his counterpart, disclosing to his alert eyes, in the perspective picture, the
geometn'c order of true reality. Neither did Alberti intend his artist to add
some tiny detail to the world created by God, but rather to create a new
world of his own, similar in structure, but not necessarily in terms of surface
appearance, to the God-created one. Alberti, consequendy, was able to
qualify the artist with the role and power of another God, Deus alter.

To describe the realization of the work of art thus detached from the
reality which Salutati had termed the factual one, Alberti could afford,
without interfen'ng with any established literary tradition, to use in his
