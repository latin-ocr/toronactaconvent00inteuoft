Blasium Hoeloelium sacri Caesaris Maximiliani consiliarium Moecenatem
eorum precipuum (hereafter CBH) were edited in late summer or early fall
of the year 1518 in Augsburg during the Imperial Diet by Petrus Bo-
nomus, then Bishop of Trieste‚ formerly secretary of the emperor.¹ Our
anthology comprises letters and poems by politicians and intellectuals
connected with the court of Maximilian 1; besides Bonomus and Holzel
they include, e.g., Sbruglio, Muzio, Peutinger, Celtis, Stabius‚ Bartholini
and Cuspinian. The earliest of the pieces go back to the 1490s‚ the latest
