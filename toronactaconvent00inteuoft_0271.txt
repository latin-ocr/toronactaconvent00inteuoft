fertile mother of twin sons, as she herself says, Lidonia is a figure of social
substance. Yet the audience's estimation of the authenticity of her inherit-
ed position-which is the sole basis of her identity—is compromised by her
long-winded pride, which in the Italian source is parodied by the inn-
keeper’s ludicrous boast about his own Sienese origins. Finally, while the
traditional disparagement of appearance in favor of inner reality is ex-
pressed overtly in Paria, it is clear that had Fulvius not looked like Archa-
icus, Flavia would never have fallen in love with him, nor, one imag-ines,
would he with her had she not accidentally satisfied both his sexual
fantasies and fears. That this love which represents the interaction of
appearance and reality is celebrated merely points out one more disquiet·
ing contradiction which the comedy cannot resolve except by conventional
closure. These contradictions are symptomatic, of course, of the political
conflict which Charles’s own paternalistic rhetoric also could not contain
when two weeks later, 17 March, he addressed the newly elected members
of his third Parliament as misbehaving children.
