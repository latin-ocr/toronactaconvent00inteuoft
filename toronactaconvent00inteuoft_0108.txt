92 PUNS, PARADoxsss, AND munusve INQUIRY

provoke and startle‚ if not estrange, the reader and have led to dystopian
interpretations of the text.²

This curious mix of the eutopian‚ utopian, and dystopian, presented in
an apparently random order, has driven translators (like readers generally)
to a variety of expedients: the Yale edition, for instance, turns “De Servis''
into “Slavery, [Etc.],'’³ while Robert Adams breaks the section into five
separate partS, highlighting the major issues, all perplexing: “Slaves‚”
“Care of the Sick and Dying,’' “Marriage Customs,'’ “Punishments‚ Legal
Procedures, and Customs‚” and “Foreign Relations.”⁴ Even Ralph Robynson
(who shared some part of More's milieu) obviously struggled before settling
for “Of Bondemen, sicke personS, wedlocke, and dyuers other matters.''5

I do not want to impose an artificial order upon this maten‘al. The
subject matter is heterogeneous, the breaks and shifts in thought crucial.
Exaggerati ng an authorial strategy and replicating the inherently paradoxi-
cal structure of the larger Utoffia, “De Servis'' depends upon pivot points
that are signalled by sharp shifts in thought.⁶ Moreover‚ the major seg·
ments are themselves unstable, breaking apart or otherwise contradicting
themselves internally and requiring us to shift our point of view and
reinterpret a text that is never univocal. There is, too, an oblique self·
referentiality about the discourse, made wholly visible when Hythlodaeus
explains how Utopians treat fools, that allows the authorial More to signal
his consciousness of the text and reinforces the joco-serious perspective

² For two different but interesting discussions of the way that utopias can be read
both as “eutopian” and dystopian, see Gary Saul Morson, The Boundaries os Genre:
Doscoevsky's “Diary osa Writer'’ and the Traditions of Literary Utopia (Austinz University
of Text Press, 1981); and Peter Ruppert, Reader in a Strange Lana: The Activity ⁰s
Reading Literary Utopias (Athens and London: The University of Georgia Press, 1986).
Also relevant is Shlomo Avineri, “War and Slavery in More's Utopia‚” Inter-national
Review of Social Histovy 7 (1962): 260-90. Sixteenth-century readers often were aware
of these tensions, sometimes characterizing Utopia as an ideal pattern, sometimes
dismissing it as a poetical (and useless) fiction, its claims both implausible and absurd.
