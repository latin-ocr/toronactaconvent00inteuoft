of the Greek upside-down by commenting, tongue-in-cheek, “Gold, alas,
does Love beget.‘'

Cowley’s “The Grasshopper,'’ his paraphrase of the “Tettix” or Cicada
poem of the Greek profits even more from the notes and translations of
his predecessors. First of all, he follows the example of the English poets
Lovelace and Stanley and turns the southern singer, the cicada, into an
English grasshopper. The lore of the happy grasshopper is n’ch in Greek
literature. Cowley would have known some of the sources Stanley cites,
notably the passage from Philostratus' “Life of Apollonius Tyanaeus’' (lib.
7, cap. 5), where Demetrius praises the happiness of the grasshoppers
singing in the summer heat (107). He also might have known the passage
from The Shield ofHeracles (393-401), where its all day singing is described
or the number of epigrams from the Greek Anthology (A.P. VII, 195, 196,
198-201; Planudes IIIa 21, 5) where its special blessedness is praised.
Cowley’s 34-line paraphrase is almost twice as long as the Greek original.
Cowley elaborates on the basic elements of the Greek lyric and includes
allusions to the larger tradition. The Greek merely says that the tettix is
drunk on a little dew; Cowley elaborates that it is “Fed with nourishment
divine'’ (3), alluding to the tradition that as a favon'te of the gods, the
cicada or grasshopper was miraculously sustained by dew alone. Estienne
and Andre use the Latin word felix (happy) for the cicada, and Cowley,
picking it up, repeats the word throughout his paraphrase, making happi-
ness the leit motis of his poem: “Happy Insect, what can bee l In happiness
compar'ed to Thee?” (1-2). For the Greek poet the tettix is wise, noble,
song-loving, and unperturbed‚ hence almost like to the gods. The translators
temper this view. For Estienne, the cicaca has no experience of evil and
suffering3 for Belleau, it is free from affection or passion. The Neapolitan
neo-Latin poet Angerianus and the French Ronsard contrast the singer’s
state with their own as excluded lovers. Angerianus complains that the cicada
sings happily under the soft leaves, while he sighs before the closed doors of
his mistress. Ronsard, transforming the cicada into a gentle loving lark, says
that she tells her love to the winds and need not sear the disdain of a proud
lover.¹⁰ For Cowley, however, the wisdom of the grasshopper lies in its use
of pleasure forits own sake, a pleasure hardly attainable on earth by human

beings: “Voluptumax, and Wise with all, s Epicurean Animal!” (32-33).
