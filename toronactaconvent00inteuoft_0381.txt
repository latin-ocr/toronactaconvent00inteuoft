Scaliger, Vinet, and the Text of Ausonius

The editio princeps of Ausonius, who was a popular poet in the
Renaissance, appeared in 1472, and the following fifty years saw his

corpus gradually augmented, interpreted, and made available to a wide
readership. The next fifty years, broadly speaking, belong in particular to
textual critics.¹ This paper will investigate an episode of Ausonian scholar-

twentieth.

A year or so before 1558 Stephanus Charpinus (Etienne Charpin)
discovered near Lyons the manuscript now at Leyden as Voss. Lat. F 111.

sixteenth century, but all he did was transcribe a very small part of it, and
very few were aware of even that much2). In 1558 Charpinus published a
new edition of Ausonius at Lyons which incorporated this new material
and in which he said, quite correctly, that he had greatly added to the text
of Ausonius. The new material naturally attracted many other scholars,
including Willem Canter‚ Pierre Pithou, Theodore Poelmann and Adri-
anus Turnebus, and in particular the subjects of this paper, Elie Vinet,
who had already produced an edition of Ausonius in 1551, and Joseph
Scaliger, who when the discovery had been made was still in his teens.

Both Vinet and Scaliger are rightly regarded by modern editors as
major contributors to the text of Ausonius: between thern they provide
