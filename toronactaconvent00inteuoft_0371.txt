Jessenius, Greek and Roman practitioners of the genre, Plato, Xenophon,
and Cicero, established the form. In spite of the suitability and adaptation
of this literary kind to the didactic purposes of analyzing and synthesizing
ideas, Sigonius was the first to present the precepts of this genre. By
collecting and studying the scattered observations of Plutarch, Athenaeus,
Ammonius, and perhaps most significantly, Diogenes Laertius, Sigonius
attempts to reconstruct the ancient theory of dialogue. His recovery of this
doctrine, though, must not be viewed as a compilation of isolated state-
ments. Rather‚ in drawing forth ancient rules, he situates this genre within
a sixteenthcentury critical context that enables him to describe dialogue
as a poetic expression of dialectical discourse.

I. Imitation: Dialogue as Poetry

According to SigoniuS, dialogue integrates the arts of poetry, rhetoric, and
dialectics. Like poetry, it is an imitation of human actions; like oratory‚ it
employs prose rather than verse. By borrowing the definition of dialogue
proposed by Diogenes Laertius in his Life os Plato (348), Sigonius sees the
substance of the genre as disputation. This division into the verba of poetic
and oratorical forms and into the nes of dialectics clearly adumbrates Tasso's
later definition of dialogue as an “imitazione di ragionament0.‘’⁷ But the
thoughts enunciated by the respective interlocutors direct attention to the
portrayal of character. Argumentation‚ then, cannot be separated from the
representation of personages. And if dialogue is the imitation of human
actions that, in turn, reflect the reasonings of fictional interlocutors, Sigonius
recognizes a need to defend the genre as a poetic form.

The delineation of characters with varying thoughts and attitudes
requires an openness of form that goes beyond technical treatise or
demonstrative discourse. For Sigonius, dialogue is not the elaboration of
a truth that can be quantified and logically verified. On the other hand, it
is not simply the representation of an exchange of words. The articulation
of ideas becomes, in this literary kind, the actions of man; for, through a
series of questions and answers and of statements and retorts, adversaries
