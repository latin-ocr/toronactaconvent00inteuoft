540 GROTIUS’S FAME As A POET

1591, when he was eight years old, onwards he produced a large number
of Latin verses, which-apart from his very first experiments—display an
astounding technical and poetical skill. This period ended in 1608, when
he embarked on a political career and devoted his attention to other
matters: the exercise of his duties and his gradual involvement in religious-
political controversies put an end to what he later called the “lusus'’ of his
youth.

Grotius's youthful poems, which we know rather comprehensively from
a collection edited by his brother Willem in 1617? may perhaps not all be
among his most outstanding poetic products, but do deserve many posi-
tive epithets: entertaining, at times amusing, ingenious, modern, virtuosic,
moving in the epicedia, exuberant in the epithalamia, biting in the mock-
ery of the epigrams, panegyric in the laudatory poems. A living document,
the collection—more so than any other source—allows us a private view of
the grandeur as well as the petite histoire of the coteries of Leyden and The
Hague at the beginning of the seventeenth century. We may be grateful to
Willem de Groot for going through with the publication of the collection
in spite of his brother's hesitations.

Some of the poems in the collection may rightly be considered part of
the most beautiful Neo-Latin poetry known to uS. Macaulay once said that
there were three poems of Catullus which he was unable to read without
being moved to tears;⁴¹ if we may extend the list by adding one of
Grotius's, it would be the poem on the portrait ofJoseph Scaliger.5 It is
one of the seven poems which Grotius wrote on the occasion of his death
and is entitled “In imaginem Scaligeri paulo ante mortem expressam.”
Departing from the emotions brought about in him by a portrait of
Scaliger which had been painted shortly before his death, Grotius success-
fully conjures up a suggestive image of the loss he has suffered. Using this
technique he creates a strong pathetic effect which time and again deeply
moves the reader; “divinum epigramma‚'' posterity called it.⁶ It is the
