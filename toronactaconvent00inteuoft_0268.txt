244 THOMAS VINCENT’S PARIA

not evade the influence of The Merchant ο] Venice. And we find details not
in Paria’s Italian source which may derive from Shakespeare's play: the
association of Eleazer with the legal system and its abuses (1748-59‚
2274-80, 2915), his ironic mention of the “dura lex” (5130) to which he
is finally subject, pork as ajewish abomination (5119), the window scene
with Fulvius and Flavia (3213), Eleazer’s meticulous locking of his house
(2991), and Astraea’s inscribed ring as a love token (1332). The innkeeper
Jodocus's sarcastic remark to Tiberius that perhaps Fulvius and Flavia
slipped out of the inn with her treasure chest to buy a long-tailed monkey
in India (2200-3) recallsJessica's night flight with Lorenzo and a casket of
her father's jewels, as well as her trading Leah‘s ring for a monkey (Mer-
chant of Venice 3.1: 118-23).

For Paria's vivid portrayal of Eleazer, there is in Luchetti'sJew Sciamoel
only the barest precedent. In the Italian comedy there is no connection
between Sciamoel and the theft of the infant Fulvio, and after the closing
of the subplot he does not reappear.

All in all, granting his comparative pettiness, Vincent's perfidious Jew
revives the villainous energy of Shakespeare's Shylock and Marlowe's ever—
popular Barabas. In act 5 scene 6, Vi ncent abandons both his source and the
requirements of his plot to elucidate the disference between Christian and
Jewish business ethics. Threatened with torture when his evasions are
exhausted‚ Eleazer finally confesses. His defense is an indictment of his race:

ELEAZER: Ι did what your law forbids but our laws freely permit.
Nothing is forbidden to us as long as we are dealing with you. Theft

reworking of a tale of mistaken identities, true and false transformations, and lovers
separated by the consequences of street violence: Romeo andJuliet and The Taming os
the δὴν-σω quickly come to mind, but, in addition, one finds isolated echoes of tavern-
scenes in I Hemy IV and striking parallels between Tiberius and Brabanfio, Desde·
mona’s deceived father in Ocliello. The marked disference between the two senes
Tiberius and Prasildo, centering on Tiberius's abused generosity, suggests that certain
details in Paria not found in Luchetti may well be from Otlzello:

(l) Othello. Her father lov'd me, ost invited me,
(1.3.128); cf. Paria 325-29.

(2) Βναὸαηεὶο. For your sake (jewel)
I am glad at soul I have no other child,
For thy escape would teach me tyranny‚

To hang clogs on ’em;
(1.3.195-98); cf. Paria 4269-80.

(3) Iag0. Awake! what ho, Brabantio! thieves, thieves, thieves!
(1.1.79); cf. Paria 3095.
