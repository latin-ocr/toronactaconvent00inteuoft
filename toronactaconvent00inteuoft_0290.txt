for us to feel entirely comfortable that we understand the meaning of
Option a. It appears that just as the ocean by mechanical motion of its
waves and water level forces water up through openings in the adjacent
lands, so the Caspian operates a smaller and independent system in the
land area surrounding it. Option b is based on the observations of Becher
that fountains or streams of water emerge from underground when
condensed by a special type of mud. Becher reached his conclusion after
studying conditions at Mount Saint Michel.⁹ Option c, like Option a, has
its roots in classical antiquity‚ not, however, in Pliny, but in Aristotle. The
ocean, Aristotle contended, disposes of the vast quantities of water which
flow into it by the process of evaporation. Instead of flooding the shores
with excess water, the ocean disposes of an amount of liquid approximate-
ly equal to the inflow when the water evaporates, travels upward and then,
because of the coldness of the air, condenses into rain and is once again
deposited upon the earth and ocean. While the correspondence of intake
and loss need not be exact in the period of a year, eventually, Aristotle
observes, a balance is achieved. In Aristotle's words:

The fresh and sweet water, then, as we said, is all drawn up because
it is light, while the salt water because it is heavy remains. . . ‚¹⁰

Kaempfer applies the Aristotelian theory to the Caspian Sea—the solution
which modern science has confirmed as correct.

We must, however, caution that Kaempfer, while he ends his speculations
with the correct solution, was by no means certain of its n'ghtness. A practic-
ing Christian and a minister's son, Kaernpfer quotes Ecclesiastes (Chap. l):

All the rivers enter into the sea, and the sea does not overssow; to
the place from whence the rivers come, they return so that they may
flow again.

But exactly how this occurs, Kaempfer concludes, “the most wise King of
mortals did not explain.'‘¹¹

Physica Subterranea (Frankfort‚ 1669), 78-89. Given to ambitious schemes, Becher
proposed a Rhine-Danube canal, the transmutation of sand into gold, and the
establishment of colonies in South America.

¹¹ Kaempfer had more than the single verse seven in mind, for chapter one of
Ecclesiastes, which focuses on the vanity of all temporal things, continues in verse

eight: All things are hard: man cannot explain them by word. The eye is not filled with seeing,
neither is the ear filled with hearing. Such a sentiment nicely captures the uncertainty

with which the discussion of the whirlpools ends.
