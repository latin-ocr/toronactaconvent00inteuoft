in arranging them in a readable sequence. With only two exceptions, he
includes all of the most popular anacreontea. Only the Cupid poems—
“The Beggar Cupid’' and “Cupid and the Bee'’—are excluded, remarkable
exclusions, however, since the Cupid poems had won the hem-ts of French
and English translators alike, with versions by Ronsard, Spenser, Watson,
Lodge, and Hern'ck, as well as many others.⁵ Cowley’s Anamonfiques,
however, have little to do with playful amorousness, so he banishes the
little winged god, though he does not banish love as a subject. Apart from
retaining Estienne's no. 1 35 his first poem and Estienne's no. 2 as his
third, Cowley completely reshuffles the order of poems. From Estienne’s edi-
tion, he adopts the practice of giving titles to the anacreontea, a practice
followed also by later translators; he retains, however, few of Estienne's
actual titles, either selecting his own or perhaps following Stanley's choices.
(See table no. 1) His choice of titles reflects, 1 think, close use of Estienne’s
edition and his notes and knowledge of Stanley’s recent translation.

Both Estienne and Stanley assert an influence on the choice and by
implication the title of Cowley’s no. 1. Estienne had argued that this lyric,
θέλω λέγειν Ἀτρεῖδας, ought to be first in the sequence because, like the
introductory poems of Ovid's Amores, it announces the subject of the
sequence as love. Esdenne, and following him Stanley, point out the close
resemblance between Ovid’s opening line, “Quum Thebae, cum Troia
foret, cum Caesaris acta, s Ingenium movit sola Corinna” (Where Thebes,
Troy, or the deeds of Caesar might have been, Corinna only moves my
wit) and the opening declaration of the poem that they place first, “I
would sing of Atreides; 1 would sing of Cadmus; but my lyre will only
speak of love.” similarly, this anacreontic’s farewell to heroes and heroic
themes and Ovid’s “Heroum clara valete s Nomina” are parallel.⁶ Es-
tienne's and Stanley’s discussion of the affinin‘es of classica} amatory elegy
and the Greek anacreontea persuade Cowley to adopt this anacreontic as
his introductory poem and to entitle it not “To the Lyre,” but “Love,”
using it as the apology for his collection. Indeed, Cowley doubles the use
of the word Iove in the opening anacreontic; in the original Greek it
appears three times, in Cowley’s rendering six.

Cowley’s careful choice of words in translating the anacreontea per-
suades me that he knew and used not just Estienne’s and Stanley’s editions
