criterion of imitation of the actions of men, and is therefore distinguished
from dialogue. Further, the physics of Empedocles and the verses of
Lucretius reproduce a picture. But in copying the nature of things, they
imitate an object, and their theory of mimesis does not satisfy the require-
ments of a faithful rendering of the actions of man. Rather, he perceives‚
through the image, the manners and distinguishing features of the repre-
sented person: “ex ea mores, at [ac] perturbationem animi perspicere
videaris” (p. 5). The selection of the object of imitation is therefore
neither random nor accidental. Instead, both the poet and orator who
engage in the creative process direct their attention to the obJect to be
reproduced by words. By identifying with the source, they attain a simili—
tude of speech and embellish it with dignity of words, elegance of style,
and copiousness of rhetorical figures. In empathyzing with the origin of
speech, the poet or orator captures idiosyncrasies that individualize
character. This finding and subsequent copying of distinguishing charac-
teristics disclose the essentia! and reflect a verbal re-creation of the
perceived person.

Dialogue is, according to Sigonius, a form of poetic imitation. Mimesis,
he contends, originates with the copying of words. Through use of Plato’s
description of discourse, and through application of Aristotle’s method of
classifying genres, Sigonius demonstrates that the selection and expression
of speech distinguish poetic genres from expository writings. Philosophical
topics inform the subject matter of dialogue. The recording of human
speech, though, reflects the actions of man, and thereby differentiates
dialogue from the matter-of-fact form of demonstrative discourse, The
categorization of dialogue as a genus of poetry satisfies definition but
raises questions of form. Sigonius turns attention to the means whereby
writers convert abstract precept into concrete techniques that elucidate
the actions (or speech) of men.

ΙΙ. Characterization: Dialogue
and the Resources of Rhetorz'c

The rhetorical precepts of verisimilitude and decorum serve as principles
in elucidating the actions (or thoughts) of men. Although dialogue is a
poetic form, the adversarial roles of the interlocutors suggest a conflict of
ideas that results in instruction. Ultimately, the validity of thought depends
upon the logic of exposition and the knowledge of topic; and Sigonius
later describes the place of dialectics in the didactic purpose. But the
