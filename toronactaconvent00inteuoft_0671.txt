ΙΙ The Dance of Death in England-⁴

The earliest known pictoria] representation in England seems to have been
the “The Dance of Paul's,” murals painted c. 1426—1430 on the walls of

the cemetery of old St. Paul’s‚ which were destroyed in 1549.¹⁰ Another
early example of c. 1465 is the sculptura! Dance of Death in the chapel of
the Earl of Rosslyn at Roslin near Edinburgh.¹¹ Dance of death wall
paintings in the Guild Chapel at Stratford-upon-Avon‚¹² partly destroyed
early in the nineteenth century, must have been known to young Shake-
speare and may have prompted his well-known lines in Measuoesor Measure
(ΙΙΙ, i, llf).¹³

WhenJohn Lydgate, Benedictine of Bury St. Edmond's, visited Paris in
1426, he made a verse translation of the “Danse macabre” poem at St
Innocents. His verses were soon circulated in manuscripts.¹⁴ At the cost
ofJenkyn Carpenter they were made to accompany the painted “Dance of
Paul’s” in the cloysters of that cathedral. Sir Thomas More refers to them
in his Four Last Things.¹⁵

How Death seizes everyone in the midst of life, is the subject of Every-
mansElckeriijk.¹⁶ The orig-ins of that late medieval morality play seem to

be shared between England and the Netherlands. In Hugo von Hofmanns·

thal‘s modern German version it continues to attract an annual audience
of many thousands at the Salzburg Festivals.¹⁷

⁹ The subject of the English Dance of Death was first treated by Francis Douce;
modern studies include Leonard Kurtz and J. M. Clark: cf. n. 1.
