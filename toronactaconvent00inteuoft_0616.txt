tions with Holzel literally, a number of them had been unsuccessfu1.³⁴
Therefore they contributed little to the glory of Hfflzel as “Maecenas.'‘

What they did show however, was Holzel as one of the “literati'’ at
court engaged in an urbane discourse with each other.³⁵ The underlying
concept is that of a “civitas doctorum,’' an (albeit invisible) community of
intellectuals, which, although geographically dispersed, would unite from
time to time in common enterprise. This idea underlies many collections
of prose and poetry of that time.³⁶ The poems praise Holzel by suggest-
ing that he belongs to that community of intellectuals and shares their
ideals, but not exclusively. The same fame is secured by the other contri-
butors still living.³⁷

Our considerations do not preclude real sponsorship on Holzel’s part.
At a Renaissance court entirely fictive praise of this kind would have been
impossible. But reality played a subordinate tole in the design of our
poems. The formative factor was the ancient poetry considered authorita-
tive. The classical prototype was remodelled in several respects to suit the
modern circumstances. The result was a synthetic pattern of literary
relations between the “literati’' on the one side and Holzel on the other.
This pattern had a double layer of significance. The equation: Horace to
Maecenas equals modern author to Holzel suggests that Holzel would
have been incited by these poetic appeals to imitate his ancient coun-
terpart's munificence. We have seen traces of the fact that the parties
concerned were well aware that neither of them was (or expected the
other to be) a second Maecenas or Horace. The poems represent a type
of civilized literary intercourse, in which the participants assumed roles
adapted from Roman literature. Tbese “impersonations” did not need to

³⁴ Cf. Celtis d3v and ἰδ’, Transilvanus 12'.

³⁵ Holzel himself is introduced as a poet in an exchange of poems between him
and Bonomus about a girlfriend of his (cv-clv). Bonomus, asked to praise Holzel’s
puella in a poem, charges his friend for concealing her and assumes that she is actually
not respectable at all. Unless Holzel produces her, he is not going to make a poem
about her: Non uisam laudare nequit mea musa (here again the promise—or in this case
denial—of a poem is in fact the poem itself ). Holzel's reply speaks about her beauty
and ends saying that, Sit tamen illa licet scortum, she hides this fact so well that she
should be praised for that. Further references to Holzel’s literary efforts are Sbrulius:
Concinit clarum liber hic poetam (alv, v. l); Cadius: A me missa breuis tibi uenit Epistola,
reddis Ι Ι Litterulas l reddis carmina carminibus (ss‘, vv. 3-4). This is quite congruent
with the ancient model, since Maecenas was also a poet (and a bad one at that).

⁸⁶ E.g., Reuchlin’s Epistulae clarorum uirorum or Hofheimer’s collection (see n. 8).

gesteigerter Wertschatzung in der Gesellschaft’' (Schottenloher, 195).
