734 LATIN EP1GRAMS ΟΝ ΕΤΙΕΝΝΕ DOLET

is borne out by Cardinal Philibert Babou de La Bourdaisiere, who appar·
ently also knew Dolet: “[. . .] Dolet un des premiers, [. . .] commencant par
assez legeres opinions et de peu d'importance‚ tomba en peu de temps es
plus execrables blasphemes que j’ouys jamais.”¹⁶ Dolet had a public and
cosmetic position represented by his pious publications and by his (nebu-
lous) declarations of belief, and a semi-public and real position which was
atheism. Having been guided to this conclusion by people who can be
trusted, one can say that it is borne out by contemporary polemicists
(from both sides of the religious divide) whose testimony one is more
inclined to treat with caution.¹⁷

Dolet's obsession for sels-justification and fame led him to a mistake
which was to prove fatal: instead of playing down the allegations of
atheism, he denied them—thus keeping alive the question, “Is Dolet an
atheist?'' In a dedicatory letter to jacopo Sadoleto in his Cato Christianus
of 1538, he drew attention to the fact that his enemies alleged he was an
atheist but claimed that the Cato Christianus would itself dispel that charge.
Guillaume Durand, in an involuntarily revealing epigram published in this
work, urged Dolet's detractors to stop describing him as “void of religion'’
and to conclude from his book that he is a “learned teacher of religion.‘'
These claims availed nothing: the book was condemned.¹⁸ Dolet added
a further profession of faith in his Genethliacum of 1539 and, in a tract
against Floridus Sabinus published in 1540, refuted the allegation (which
Sabinus had made the year before) that he had denied the immortality of the
soul.¹⁹ However‚ the manner of Dolet’s protests of orthodoxy remains
truculent. And their content remains nebulous. The same contempt for
dogmatic theology which made the De Imitatione Ciceroniana such an elecm’fy-
ing document pervades or underlies his subsequent statements on religion.
None of these statements silenced his foes: Sabinus attacked him for irrelig-

¹⁷ Calvin declared‚ in his Traitte‘ des scandales: “Chacun seait qu'Agrippa‚ Vil-
leneuve, Dolet, et leurs semblables ont tousjours orgueilleusement contemne l'Evan-
gile: en la fin, ils sont tombez en telle rage, que non seulement ilz ont dcsgorge leurs
blasphemes execrables contre Jesus Christ et sa doctrine, mais ils ont esame, quant ὲ
leurs ames, qu'ils ne differoient en rien des chiens et des pourceaux’' (ed. Ο. Fatio,
Geneve, 1984, 136-38). Cf. the verdict of Proteolus [Gabriel Du Preau?] cited by
Maittaire, ΙΙΙ, i, 106, note (m), from Bayle, Dici, 11, 1012.
