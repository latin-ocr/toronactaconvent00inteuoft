ECKHARD BERNSTEIN 251

poems of the Querelae in which he not only describes with great rhetorical
vehemence and obsessive repetition the alleged injun'es he had suffered,
but also tn'es to enlist the help and win the understanding of a variety of
friends, acquaintances and benefactors‚ ranging from Duke Boguslav of
Pomerania and his uncle Ludwig von Hutten to friends like Crotus
Rubeanus and Eobanus Hessus and many others. The tenth elegy of the
second book, called “Ad poetas Germanos‚''⁴ describes a fictitiousjourney
his muse undertakes through Germany with the following mandate: “Sed
pete Germanos ex ordine quemque poetasJPatn'a vel quos hoc nomine terra
colit'' (line 9 f.). What follows is a detailed itinerary combined with a cata-
logue of fifty poetae, the name, of course, given to those men we now call
humanists (i.e., men who were specifically occupied with literary matters).

Hutten’s muse starts her journey in Rostock and then proceeds via
Danzig to Frankfurt an der Oder. Silesia and Bohemia are the next
stations in this literary pilgrimage. From Wittenberg‚ the following destina-
tion, the muse is instructed to hurry to Leipzig, Magdeburg, Erfurt, and
nearby Gotha. After briefly visiting Wfirzburg the muse comes to Fran-
conia, Hutten‘s native region, and the ancient city of Fulda. From there
she repairs first to Westphalia and then to Cologne. After travelling up the
Rhine with visits to Koblenz, Mai nz, Speyer and Strassburg the muse ends
her journey in Tiibingen.

Since in each of these cities‚ one or several poets are visited, we have in
effect a catalogue of German literary men at that time. Among them are
such well-known names as Georg Spalatin, Rhagius Aesficampianus,
Crotus Rubeanus, Eobanus Hessus, Mutianus Rufus,Johannes Trithemius,
Hermann von dem Busche, jakob Wimpfeling, Heinrich Bebel, and
Johannes Reuchlin. In addition we find a great many men who have made
it to this honors list only on the strength of their fn’endship with Hutten.⁵

The poem, however, is not merely a catalogue but a collection of
thumbnail sketches of these litem-ati. Taking advantage of Latin’s penchant

⁴ Bocking 3:64-81.

⁵ There are, of course, some prominent names missing on that list. That Erasmus
of Rotterdam‚ Conrad Celtis, Philipp Melanchthon, and Hermann von Neuenaar are
not mentioned is understandable. Erasmus was living in England at that time, Celtis
had died two years before, and Neuenaar and Melanchthon were too young. More
surprising is the absence of the Viennese humanists Joachim Vadianus and Johannes
Cuspinianus, as well as the absence of Conrad Peutinger from Augsburg and willibald
Pirckheimer from Nuremberg, Ulrich Zasius from Freiburg, and Beatus Rhenanus
from Schlettstadt. Tbere are explanations at least for Vadian, Peutinger and Zasius. All
three had not published anything of note at this particular time and Beatus' Life os
Gailer von Kayersberg appeared only in 1510.
