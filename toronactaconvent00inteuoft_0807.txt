in ContinentalJesuit Drama

FRIEDRICH·K. UNTERWEG

l n the course of a good two hundred years between the beginnings of
Jesuit drama and the dissolution of the order in 1773, the Jesuits adapted
an enormous van'ety of subjects for performances on their college stages.
When they realized that their plays were an excellent medium for their
moral-didactical and religious-propagandist purposes, they made great efforts
to reach as great an audience as possible, and thus kept enlarging their
traditional canon of plays by adding new and atu-active themes. The perfor-
mances of their plays were often characterized by great magnificence and
soon proved to be the cultural event of a town or city. Often the plays were
attended by hundreds of visitors from the surrounding regions.

In view of the immense number of plays about very different subjectS‚
it is quite difficult to obtain a general view of the subject-groups and to
make reliable statements about the rank and popularity of certain subjects
within the Jesuits’ canon of dramatic works.

In her stimulating study Geschichte, Politik und Gesellschafl im Drama des
17. Jahrhunderts, Elida Man‘a Szarota has pointed out that in Jesuit plays-—
unlike humanist dramas-the importance of historical subjects gradually
grew after the end of the sixteenth century.¹ In a later article she stressed
the important role of Spanish and English history forJesuit dramatists and
discussed ten plays dealing with Henry 11 and his chancellor Thomas
Becket‚ Henry VIII, and the martyrs John Fisher and Thomas More, Mary
Stuart‚ Charles 1, and Thomas Cromwell.²
