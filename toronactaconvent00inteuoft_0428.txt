404 THE PROLOGUES oF coMOEmA SACRA

more highly esteemed and more read, were it not that earlier imitators of
Terence had evidently not found much to interest them in prologues of
either type. Hroswitha, for example, who consciously presents her work as
a kind of more improving version of Terence, writes no counterpart to the
Terentian prologue. Her public statement of her aims is contained in a
preface to each play; within the play itself, as it might be performed, the
author remains invisible. Prologues of a sort start to appear, usually in
addition to the prefatory letter of the printed text, in the comedies of the
late fifteenth century, such asJacob Wimpfeling's Stylpho (1480), where the
prose drama is introduced by a short prologue in elaborate, periodic
prose, quite unlike anything in the Roman dramatists. The appearance of
prologues in such pieces seems largely motivated by a desire to conform
with the text-books and to a lesser extent with the models, rather than by
any internal need. Although these plays were performed as well as read,
the published version probably reached a larger audience, and it was
natural that the author’s main statement of his aims should still appear in
the letter prefacing the play’s printed edition.

It is only with Reuchlin’s two short comedies, Hermo (= Scaenica pro-
gymnasmata, 1490) and Sergius (c 1504) that anything like the ancient
prologue starts to emerge. The two verse prologues, short as the plays
themselves are short, include in each case a plea for attention, an outline
of the plot, and a comment on the author’s achievement in the play, thus
corresponding to Donatus' “mixed'' type of prologue. Reuchlin himself
apparently wrote no dedicatory letter for the publication of his plays,
concentrating on the play as performance. The prologues themselves state
no more about his aims than the classically-derived but not comic conceit
that he wishes to bring Greek and Roman pastimes to Germany.¹

True comoedia sacra begins with Gnapheus' Acolastus of 1529,2 which

¹ Scenica progymnasmata (=Henno), prologue:

optans poeta placere paucis versibus
sat esse adeptum gloriae arbitratus est
si autore se Germaniae schola luserit
Graecanicis et Romuleis lusibus.

Compare the figure in Hor. Carm. 3.30.13-14, Virg. Geo. 2176, and many other places
in classical Latin poetry.

² This honour is often accorded to Macropedius' sisoius, which although published
in 1537 is stated by its author to have been wn'tten some thirty years previously. This
would have been a remarkable anticipation of what is essentially a new genre, and
while Macropedius may very well have composed a prodigal-son drama at that date, 1
find it hard to believe that the revision undergone for the printed edition was not in
effect a re-writing.
