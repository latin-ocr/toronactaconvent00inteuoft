The Present State of Scholarship
in Renaissance Epistolography

EMIL J. POLAK

Ι here has been significant growth in the interest and study of Renais-

sance epistolography in recent years. This talk dealt with the
expanding research and increasing number of studies on the historical and
literary aspects of the art of letter writing from the fourteenth through the
seventeenth century. The appearance of two international scholarly
organizations, the IANLS and the ISHR, has facilitated the expanding
interest in a generally neglected subject. Some university courses now
include the study of the ars dictaminis; Ph.D. dissertations are presenting
the results of original research on various aspects of epistolary composi—
tion. Monographs, chapters in books on rhetoric, and encyclopedia entries
on this field of discourse have been appearing in increasing number. A
variety of journals has contained the results of investigations on the
subject.

Attention was also given to the enormous amount of exploration‚
examinafion, and analysis that remains to be done. Most of the epistolo-
graphers and their works have not been studied. The relationship of the
Medieval dictaminal tradition and Renaissance Humanism requires study.
The letters in the formularies and model letter collections merit examina-
tion for various purposes. The practice of letter writing in relation to the
theory and doctrines is itself worthy of examination. In sum, an important
part of the intellectual life extending from England to Poland and Czecho·
slovakia over a span of four hundred years deserves systematic and careful
study.
