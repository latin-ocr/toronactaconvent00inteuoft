time, and their task in a way consisted in either writing a continuation to
him, or translating him into Danish. Despite many attempts in the course
of the sixteenth century, a complete official history of Denmark in elegant
Latin did not see the light until more than one hundred years after the
publication of Saxo, and moreover written by historiographers called in
from the Netherlands. The upheavals of the Reformation explain the lack
of results in the early part of the period, but the demand to emulate
Saxo‘s greatness may also have acted as a psychological stumbling block.

In the meantime, the Danish government in the 1540s supported the
printing of Albert Krantz's almost half a century old history of the Scandi-
navian kingdoms, both in the original Latin and in a German translation.
No less than Philip Melanchthon seems to have acted as a go-between in
the affair.¹⁶ Krantz was one of Saxo's ardent admirers, as we have seen,
and in general Denmark was most fully and most positively treated among
the three kingdoms. That should be enough to explain the official Danish
interest in Krantz.

In 1523, Sweden liberated herself finally from the Scandinavian union.
The resulting rivalry between Denmark and Sweden in fact inspired the
most extraordinary work among those written by Saxo’s followers. That
was Johannes Magnus's Histovy of the Kings os the Swedes and the Goths,
finished about 1540, and published posthumously in Rome in 1554.¹⁷

Johannes Magnus went in exile in 1526 as the last catholic archbishop
of Sweden. The coolness between him and the new regime in Sweden
grew steadily. NeverthelessJohannes Magnus remained an ardent Swedish
patriot all his life, and in the long years of exile he collected material for
a patriotic history of Sweden. A fundamental part of his patriotism was a
burning hatred for everything Danish. As a writer of Swedish history he
had to take issue with Saxo and Saxo's picture of Sweden as a barbarian
country which for long periods was nothing more than a Danish vassal
state. Moreover‚ he simply must outdo Saxo's imposing series of about
one hundred Danish kings.

Johannes Magnus solved the problem by taking up the medieval identi-

surveyed by Ellen Jorgensen, Historiesorskning og Historiaekrivning ί Danmark indtil Aar
1800 (Copenhagenz Hagerup, 1931).
