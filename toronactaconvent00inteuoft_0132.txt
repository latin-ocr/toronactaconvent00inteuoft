eius rei quam alieno verbo posuimus similitudo.’'⁸ Yet the metaphor,
relying on similitude, is nonetheless alienum, out of its proper place.
There is a one-to-one correspondence between word and thing that
metaphor supplements and temporarily disrupts.

Since, then, metaphor was seen as a kind of disruption even by an
author like Cicero, who championed its use, it was important for writers
and rhetoricians to determine exactly what level of disruption was tolera-
ble in order to protect the representational function of language. Derri-
da’s White Mythology describes this task first of all in terms of a mapping
out of linguistic territory for the discipline of philosophy. Pure philosophy,
which seeks the truth, can use language only in a way that leaves no room
for metaphor or word play: nouns in their proper sense name things, and
this is the foundation of all philosophy.

A noun is proper when it has but a single sense. Better, it is only in
this case that it is properly a noun. Univocity is the essence, or
better, the telos of language. No philosophy as such has ever re-
nounced this Aristotelian ideal. This ideal is philosophy.⁹

What univocity accomplishes is a doubling so perfect that the language is
ultimately self-cancelling. Aristotle’s careful distinctions between rhetoric
and philosophy on the one hand and rhetoric and poetics on the other are
an attempt to control, through the separation of disciplines by linguistic
practices, the disruption of all tropes in language-use. Good rhetoric is
designated as the art of persuasion; or, more specifically, “the faculty of
discovering in the particular case what are the available means of persua—
sion.''¹⁰ Unlike philosophy, it must deal with signs and names. It shares
with philosophy the recognition that language is purely conventional, not
natural,ll yet it must avoid becoming false rhetoric by refrajning from
any exploitation of the contingency of signifiers, concerning itself rigor—
ously with the truth. In cases where the truth is not determined‚ rhetoric

the undesirable conclusion that rhetoric could participate in persuading someone to
believe a falsehood3 thus in the case of a falsehood, there would be no proper means
of persuasion available to the art of rhetoric.
