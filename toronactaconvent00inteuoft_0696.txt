670 MARc-ANTorNE MURET

To return to the teaching of literature: the speech De utilitate, jucun-
ditate ac praestantia literarum (1573), which extends literature to include
“earum artium quae in litteris continentur‚” deals with the professional or
occupational purpose of studying literature. He sets before his wealthy
young pupils four kinds of people: the idle, pleasure-seeking rich, poor
boys who have to follow a trade, soldiers, and scholars of literature. He
contrasts literature with other arts: although agriculture and commerce
are vital to the state, the cultivation of the spirit is nobler than that of the
soil, small trade is sordid and great is perilous and based solely on gain;
painting and sculpture are not sordid, and provide “honesta voluptas‚’'
preserve the memory of famous men and invite us to imitate them, but it
is only through literature that we know of the ancient artists, who can
represent only the body, and of their works which can be seen only in one
place and are ephemeral. Literature reproduces thoughts, behavior,
actions and is eternal. Military glory depends on literary records. Muret
next develops, rather reluctantly, the argument that literature can be
financially rewarding‚ as it was, or could have been, for Thales, Gorgias,
Isocrates, Seneca. The ending of the speech is more idealistic: “Literae
inditos nobis a natura honestatis igniculos excitant; luxuriantes quasique
fruticantes cupiditates stringunt ac coercent, easque rationis finibus
regunt’' (208). Unlike Montaigne, he thought the path to learning and
virtue was not easily accessible.

So far we have looked at Muret's theory of the teaching of literature
and this may be checked against his learned editions, such as those of
Catullus, Tibullus and Propertius, or of Cicero, and may also be compared
with his commentaries‚ including his personal and urbane Variae lectiones.
From all of these there emerges a highly refined view of imaginative
writing and especially of poetry, which is a divinely inspired, prophetie
force, producing in the poet “mirificum quoddam ingenii acumen,'' and
not reducible to art. Poetry works on our emotions by imitation—“Omnis
autem imitatio videri vult id quod non est: itaque quodam genere menda-
cium est” (330)—proceeding by “veritatis similitudinem.'' The poet must
be learned, teach the reader or hearer to speak well and invite him to
virtue. It is this elevated (and new) ideal which the teacher of literature
must aspire to.⁸

It is also possible to compare Muret's general statement of his views
with the detailed plan of study he drew up, De via ac ratione tradendarum

but are easily findable in the collected works.
