634 BARTHOLOMAEUS COLONIENsls: Two FABLEs

Not counting their length, these fables seem, at first, to be what their
title pronounces them to be: scenes from animal life with a moralizing
application. Taken together, their common ancestry is obvious: Phaedrus’s
Fabula de corvo et vulpe in Avianus's metre, after various mediaeval and
Renaissance versions chiefly known to us from La Fontaine's Le corbeau et
le renard. There are, however, striking differences. To begin with, the first
fable is entitled Fabula de gallo et vulpe in qua latenter deridetur inanis gloria
cuiusdam poetae. A bird, by the not only groundless, but in this case hilari-
ously exaggerated flattery of a fox, is coaxed into doing something that
will prove highly deleterious to itself. Although the story is broadly the
same as Phaedrus’s and its successors, the changed title connected with
this story has no parallel i'n the vast corpus of post-classical fable-literature.
There is, incidentally, in the Romulus-collection a Fabula de gallo et vulpe,
but its story and its ending are completely different.¹¹ But there is more.
The main object of the fox in the orthodox version of the fable is a piece
of cheese in unlawful possession of the raven. The fox tries to get hold of
it by flattering the bird into singing and thus opening its beak. Bartholo-
maeus’s variation on Phaedrus’s theme, however, introduces a fox that,
not satisfied with so small a reward, aims at making a meal of the bird
itself, in the end successfully.

The second fable seems at first to be traditional in its title and in the
moral precept the title contains: Fabula de corvo et vulpe in qua latenter
praemonemur nefidem adhibeamus adulatorum blanditiis. But again all si milar-
ity to its classical and mediaeval predecessors ceases here. Within the
space of the first ten lines it becomes evident that the fox has malicious
intentions on the life of the raven. Simulating a grave illness, it tries to
convince the bird that it is the only one that can cure him, simply by
embracing and kissing him, a piece of advice that he was given, so he says,
by the priestess of the oracle at Delphi. The raven immediately spots the
pitfall and, indignant for being considered stupid enough to succumb to
the flatteries of the fox, compares these to seemingly harmless animals
that have an unexpected but effective weapon like scorpions and bees.
The fox, not to be outbidden, replies at length with a long catalogue of
similar animals, assuring the raven that it is unjust and groundless to

¹¹ This is the fable on which Chaucer's The Nun’s Priest's Tale is based. There is,
however, some resemblance to a fable in the Directorium humanae vitae ofJohannes de
Capua (see Hervieux, ibid., V, 201) and to one in the Speculum sapientiae of (ps.—)
Cyrillus. See J. G. Th. Crasse, Die beiden (illesten lateinischen Fabelbiicher des· Mittelalcers
(Hildesheim, 1965), 51-52.
