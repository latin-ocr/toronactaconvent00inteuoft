CHARLES FANTAzm 145

Ciceronian character, but Barzizza does not hesitate to use unfamiliar
words from the comic writers and later Latin usage. In substantiation of
what Sabbadini remarked only en passam, 1 shall give a list, which does not
at all pretend to be exhaustive, of some of the non-Ciceronian words
found in these model letters. From Plautus and Terence Barzizza takes
such words and expressions as animo otioso, integrescit, percunctator, inter·
minatus sum. He is not averse to using vocabulary from Seneca, Tacitus
and Quintilian not to be found in Cicero, such as captivitas, praeoccupare,
proficius in the sense of profit, pollicitatio, common enough in other
wn‘ters, but found only once in Cicero, in antecessum accipere. At other
times he introduces words from late Latin writers, terms from the jurists,
fideiussio, sarcinulas componere (“pack up your belongings'') from Ulpian,
ultimately from Varro; principans, found in Sidonius Apollina1is; machina·
menta in a transferred sense, witnessed only by Apuleius; and non-classica!
words such as defloratam, fimerarer, pecuniola, car-itudo, detractione, in its
modern connotation; or expressions that are not found in classical writers,
such as oculi dolere or crepare, in the sense of envy, and the phrases ab
inexpectato and in praesentia.

In matters of syntax 1 should characterize Barzizza’s style as cautious,
avoiding longer periods and seeming to favour constructions such as
concessive clauses, comparative noun clauses, indirect questions and the
like. From Cicero Barzizza den'ves a predilection for balanced antithesis,
which he uses to good effect, as “periculum factum est, unde praesidium
expectabamus,’' (Furietti, p. 226); or “odium pro benevolentia consequi et
quos nostro devinctos beneficio speramus, eosdem nobis inimicos red-
dere²’ (Furietti, p.309); “nullam rem tam arduam esse quam non putem
esse levissimam” (Furietti, p. 324). Alliteration is another rhetorical device
frequently exploited in the prose of the letters, sometimes enhanced by a
kind of emulation in the use of this figure by the two fictitious correspon-
dents. One letter ends: “speramus clementiam suam mutaturam esse in
melius mala, quibus conflictamur ac pene conficimur”(Fun‘etti‚ p. 253);
the next one begins: “literae tuae tantam attulerunt animo meo molestiam
ut nullo tempore majori in maerore fuerim.”

The didactic method of the pairing of letters allows for the teaching of
the use of synonyms and similar expressions, as the respondent comments
on the contents of the letter he has received. This is illusnated in the very
first exchange. In referring to the rejection of a former friend, the verb
rejiciebam is varied to destituissent in the second letter, and the sentiment
“tamen cum ad incredibilem animi tui sapientiam judicium meum refe-
rebam, nihil erat, quare id a te improbari putarem'' (Furietti, p. 220) is re-
echoed in different words, “tamen cum haberem animum tuum multis
