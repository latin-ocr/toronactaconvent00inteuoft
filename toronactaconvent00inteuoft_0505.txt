The Liturgical Context of Erasmus's Hymns

CLARENCE H. MILLER

Sometimes we tend to forget that Erasmus was a priest and an
Augustinian canon regular in good standing throughout his life.l
Though he never functioned as a pastor or held ecclesiastical office, he
certainly would have said mass regularly and read the divine office daily.
Hence the missal and the breviary² would have been quite as well known
to him (though perhaps less consciously) as his favorite classical authors.
Erasmus’s liturgy is understandably not as familiar to his modern students.
Hence the Toronto editors osone of his letters³ misidentified a quotation
from a sequence for the Transfiguration. And when the modern editor of
Erasmus’s poems⁴ pointed out in Erasmus’s hymn to St. Michael “a rather
striking parallel'' with a sequence attributed to Alcuin, we will find the

¹ In The spirituality ⁰s Erasmus of Rotterdam, Biblioteoe Humanistica 8c Reforma-
torica, vol. 40 (Nieuwkoopz De Graaf, 1987), Richard L. DeMolen has recently
reminded us of Erasmus’s religious and sacerdotal commitment.

² To say the missal and the breviary is misleading‚ since neither was standardized
until the Council of Trent and there was a bewildering variety of both in Erasmus's
time, especially of the breviary. 1 have had to be content with the Windesheim
breviary, which may or may not have been used at Steyn while Erasmus was there; the
edition 1 have consulted was also adapted for cambrai, where Erasmus lived from
1492 to 1495: Breuiarium consuetudinem ad Canonicorum regularium instituti diui patris
Augustini episcopi. congregationis Windesimensis . . . In quo . . . addita quaedam sunt. quae
etiam alijs extra diocesim Traiectensem degentibus. &precipue Cameracensi conuenire possint
(Antwerpt for Henricus Eckertanus de Homberch, 24 September 1519), microfilm of
the copy in the British Library, cited as Windeskeim-Cambrai Breviary. 1 have also
consulted the missals and other breviaries from the continent and England which are
available in modern editions.

³ As 1 have pointed out in Renaissance Quarterly 31 (1978): 60.
