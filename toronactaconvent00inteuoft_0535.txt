In the beginning of humanist education, or very near it, was the school
of Guarino of Verona (1370-1460), at which “the practice of making
extracts . . . and of collecting parallel passages from different authors” was
well-established.³ But this was not the beginning of commonplace books.
Despite its crucial role in the recovery of classioel culture, the origins of
the Renaissance commonplace book lie neither in humanist schools nor in
antiquity itself. The pattern was set in the Middle Ages, not by odd
random sequences of extr-acts, but by thoroughly systematic methods of
information retrieval developed from the thirteenth century onwards for
the benefit of preachers. These were in effect commonplace books. They
extrapolated from a canon of authors, the excerpts were entered under
heads inevitably chosen to suit the moral and doctrinal preoccupations of
sermon-writers, and they were usually meticulously cross-referenced. The
purpose was rhetorical: to supply material for persuasive discourse and to
authenticate it by reference to authoritative texts. A history of the human-
ist commonplace book needs to look at the organisation of these preach-
ing manuals, and, more particularly, at those which were printed, and, by
implicafion, sold and used at the end of the fifteenth century and at their
subsequent publishing history. At the very moment that Northern human·
ism was taking off, printed medieval commonplace books display the wide
range of investigative and exegetical techniques to which the common-
place-book formula had already been adapted.

The simplest form of the preaching commonplace book is exemplified
by the Manipulus florum of Thomas of Ireland, written in 1306 (first
pn’nted at Piacenza, 1483). The preface to the early printed editions
stresses the virtues of orderly classificadon, and the work is a retrieval
system for finding apposite quotations from the Fathers and the Doctors
of the Church, and from Cicero, Seneca, Valerius Maximus and Aulus
Gellius on an extensive list of moral and doctrinal topics arranged in strict
alphabetical sequence. No rhetorical or interpretative strategies are
indicated. Τὴε work survived as a useful reference tool, printed and
plundered throughout the sixteenth, seventeenth and even eighteenth
centuries‚ by Catholics and Protestants alike.⁴ Compiled slightly later, and
