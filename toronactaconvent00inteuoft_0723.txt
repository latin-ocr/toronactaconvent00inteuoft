The Herculean Lover
in the Emblems of Cranach and Vaenius

The emblem book was a major Neo-Latin literary genre during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centun‘es in Europe. Such books, which

were also translated into or originally composed in the vernacular, basical-
ly consisted of a collection of verse epigrams. Each epigram was accompa-
nied by either a motto or a short topical statement, and most were illus-
trated—at first by crude woodcuts but later by more sophisticated engrav-
ingS. The literary purpose of this tripartite genre appears to have been the
writing of endless (and often quite subtle) variations on those traditional
themes or lopoi which seemed appropriate to the poet for commentary on
personal or national problems and events.

But all Renaissance emblems did not follow the usual tripartite form of
motto, picture, and verse; indeed some were called “blind emblems”
because they had no pictures, while others—such as certain oil paintings
incorporating a verse into the picture—did not include a motto‚ nor did
they appear in a book. Still other emblematic paintings included a motto
but not a verse. To further complicate matters, Renaissance decorators
often reproduced only the pictures from popular emblem books on
ceilings, tapestry borders, and embroidered fabrics, assuming that the
viewer would already know the motto and its verse, which he usually did.
In any case, emblems, whether wn'tten in Latin or in a vulgar tongue,
became an established genre among educated people soon after the
publication in 1531 of the first Emblemata by Andrea Alciati in Augsburg.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the changing relationship
between Hercules and Amor within this widespread emblem tradition. I
shall discuss not only three printed emblems by Otto van Veen
(1556-1629) but also two unusual and interesting painted emblems by the
