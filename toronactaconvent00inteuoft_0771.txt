an obvious parallel to Mutius’s practice is Vida’s Christiad which manages
to recount the entire life of Christ but whose dramatic setting is actually
just a few days before Chn‘st’s death.¹⁴

It should be observed that there is much about the epic theory and
practice of Macarius Mutius that is unoriginal. Christian poetry was not so
completely nonexistent in the late fifteenth century as Mutius would have
his readers believe. There were a number of Mutius’s contemporaries who
were writing biblical poetry in the period. Nor was the knight from
Camerino the first poet to come up with the idea of writing about the
harrowing of Hell in verse. Venantius Fortunatus, Andre de Coutances,
and others had all tried their hand at versifying this particular subject.¹⁵
We should also note that there is little in Mutius's two prefaces that is
actually original with him. One suspects that he borrowed many of his
conventional ideas and arguments from some convenient source such as
the Apologeticon to Mantuan's first Parthenice.

On the other hand, we do know that Mutius's short epic was quite
popular in the next century. A number of different editions of De triumpho
Christi appeared between 1500 and 1567. As mentioned above, Mutius was
especially popular in Germany. Editions of his poem were produced in
Erfurt, Cologne, and Strasburg¹⁶ and it is likely that his epic inspired a
number of German poets (including Eobanus Hessus, Matthias Funk, and
johannes spangenberg) to write on the same subject. It is also quite
possible that Mutius’s poem was the inspiration for Erasmus's epyllion
written on the same subject.¹⁷ As late as the eighteenth century, we find
the youthful Goethe undertaking to write a poem on the same theme, with
the title Poetische Gedanken iiber die H5llensahn Jesu Christi (1765).¹⁸ In
Italy, too, Mutius was popular and well respected throughout the sixteenth
century. The De triumpho Christi was reissued a number of times in Venice

¹⁴ Most of the events of Christ’s life are represented as being told to Pilate by his
father Joseph and his disciple John in the third and fourth books of the poem.

¹⁷ In a paper presented to the Seventh International Congress of the International
Association for NeoLatin Studies, Harry Vredeveld argued persuasively that De
triumpho Christi inssuenced Erasmus's Carmen heroicum de solemnitate paschali alque de
tryumphali Christi resurgentis pompa et descensu eius ad inferos and that the latter work
should be dated to 1499 rather than to c. 1489 (as it is by Reedijk, 189-90).
