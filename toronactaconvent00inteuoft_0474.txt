450 CATULLAN NEo-LArlN POETRY

survey on Catullus, published in 1988, “much work needs to be done on
the inssuence of Catullus on the early Renaissance in Italy and France,’' but
did not mention Neo-Latin poetry at all among the fields on which Catullus
had an impact. Such restraint is not justified even in view of the scant lit-
erature on the subject. It can only be explained by the unfortunately still ex-
isting blindness of some classicists in front of the phenomenon of Neo-Latin.
All this caused me to ask: how was Catullus received after his rediscovery?
Where and when did the composing of poems in Catullan style originate?
What were the motifs? What was considered to be Catullan and what was re-
produced? What was the purpose of these poems? And finally: Which impact
did these poems have on the later Catullan poetry of the Renaissance?

The still existing controversy, whether the Catullus manuscript which is
the source of our tradition was brought from France to Verona around
1300 or if this manuscript always lay in Verona and was rediscovered
around that time, is not immediately relevant to our problems. It may only
be stated that there is no evidence that Lovato knew Catullus around
1265, as some scholars believed, following an article of Guido Billanovich
in 1958. He thought that the word connections acrior ignis and imbre
madet, which occur in a poetical letter of Lovato from 1268, are proof that
Lovato had read Catullus by that time. As Ι demonstrated in an article in
the Rheinisches Museum of 1986, these word connections do not go back
to Catullus, but to Seneca and Statius. But did Lovato ands or Mussato
imitate Catullus at a later time? The problem here is first, whether certain
words and word connections, which in identical or similar forms appear
in texts of these early humanists and in Catullus, but also in other ancient
authors, do come from Catullus or not. In each case a close comparison
of the different contexts is necessary. Sometimes we will only be able to
decide such questions with higher or lesser degrees of probability. But in
whichever way such parallels are evaluated, the use of some single Catul-
lan words or word connections in the hexameters and distichs of Lovato
and Mussato can never be interpreted as an attempt to compose poems in
Catullan style. It would always be only the use of ancient word material
which they took from Catullus as well as from other ancient authors.
Augusto Sainati wrote in 1972 that Mussato imitated the passer poem of
Catullus “in una svelta poesiola.'’ But in that epigram Mussato only says
that he does not write poems like Virgil's first Eclogue or like Catullus's
passer-poem, and the phrasing of this statement is not even specifically
Catullan. Ι recommend to use the term imitation more restrictively.
Otherwise we have to call almost any relationship of a later text to an
earlier one an imitation and have to find new terms for those phenomena
which more properly are designated with this term.
