O ne of Vives’s less well known rhetorical treatises is De consultatione,
“On political deliberation'' or “On deliberation.” Vives wrote this
short work during his stay at Oxford in 1523, at the request of Louis of
Flanders, a nobleman, who was at that time the ambassador of Emperor
Charles V at the English court.¹ This work has been somewhat neglected

rhetorical writings both in length and in number of edin‘ons. It has been
cn‘ticized strongly by the Spanish scholar Bonilla y San Martin, who
considers it a bad politioe] treatise and who writes, among other thingS,

adaptations made by Vives to classical deliberative oratory, especially his
