9:21); “there is a pleasant play [iumnda allusio] in the Greek
. . .ὑπερῴρονεῑν, Φρονεῑν, εἰς τὸ σωφρονεῖν”(“.ςαρηε” 6301) [1516] on
Rom. 1223). In Rom. 4:18 Erasmus notes the iucunda relatio of the appar-
ently contradictory “beyond hope, he believed through hope‘’ (“in spem'’
581C [1519]); and in Rom. 1338 he recalls Augustine to observe the gratia
of the “pairs‚” “tribute to whom tribute,’' “tax to whom tax, . . .'’ (“nemini''
6361) [1519]).

Apart from several passages of elaborate stylistic analysis which we shall
presently observe, the 1527 edition adds relatively little to an appreciation
of the pleasure to be derived from the language of Paul. When we do
meet observations of this kind in the 1527 edition, we generally find them
in the context of a more technical rhetorical vocabulary. Thus to the
annotation just cited on Rom. 4:8‚ Erasmus added in 1527 the word
“traductio'' Already in 1516 he had found the repetition of δικαιοσύνην
in Rom. 1023 festivior, but in 1527 corrected the technical term from
conduplicatio to traductio (“et suam'' 617E).⁶ Similarly in 1527 he explained
further the pleasure he had found in 1516 in the words
ἀπειθοῦσι-πειθομένοις of Rom. 2;8, by adding a clause noting that these
words exemplify ἑναντῖωσις. Or again, he identifies for the first time in
1527 the δῑλημμα of Rom. 4:10 as a rhetorical figure and speaks of the
gratia it brings (“in circumcisione,” 578F).

The last two editions do, however, show a much more lively interest in
the “forcefulness'' of Paul's language and thought than did the first two.
It is true that Erasmus had recognized in 1516 and 1519 some features in
the Pauline text that intensifled the expression. But the editions of 1527
and* 1535 contain approximately twice as many observations on the
“force” of Pauline expression as those of 1516 and 1519.⁷ In 1527 he
expresses repeated interest in the effect of the “question'' (interrogatio and
percontatio) in Romans. He comments on the question of Rom. 3:27
(“Where now is boasting?”), that “questions” (percontationes) of this sort
greatly add to the sharpness of a passage (“ubi est” 577B). One finds
similar observations in the annotations on Rom. 4:10 (“in circumcisione'’
578F) and Rom. 1111 (“dico” 621C). Further‚ he defends readings of the
Greek text in part on the basis of the effectiveness of expression, appar-
ently with the assumption that Paul strove for force, sharpness, and
dignity of language. In 1535 he added to a note begun in 1516 and

⁶ On conduplicatio see Ecclesiastes 3 (LB V 990F—91A and 999E-10000).

⁷ 1 count 12 such observations in the last two editions as opposed to 6 in the first
two.
