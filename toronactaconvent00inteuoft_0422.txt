it will not be possible; in either case a limit is established.
3. 285-483—There is not an infinite number of atoms of each shapez⁸

(a) Take the number of cubed atoms; they do not fill all space at one time,
otherwise there would be no room for atoms of other shapes; there-
fore, if no one type of atom can fill all of space, no one type is infinite
in number. Further, since it is agreed that the number of shapes is
limited and has been shown that the number of atoms of each shape is
also limited, the total number of atoms must be finite (285-331).

(b) If there were an infinite number of atoms of every shape this would
mean that there would be an infinite number of examples of every
species of thing; this is not so; therefore, the number of atoms of each
shape is limited.

Lucretius is mistaken, then, in claiming an infinite number of atoms and
infinite number of atoms of every shape. The incalculable range of combi-
nations among just a limited number of atoms of a fixed number of
shapes is sufficientto account for the variety of forms in the natural
world. One need look only at the game of chess to appreciate what a
multitude of variations can be achieved with but a few pieces.

B. The atoms are not indivisible

1. 523-76: If the atoms are to have shape—and this is necessary if they are
to combine to form compound bodies—then they must have parts. If
they have parts, they are divisible. Moreover, even if you deny the
atoms shape, they will still have parts; as units of matter they have
extension‚ and everything that has extension is infinitely divisible.
Polignac expectedly strikes at the heart of the question, finding it
impossible to conceive of extended matter which is not infinitely

⁸ Lucretius’s main argument for an infinite number of atoms of each shape is
given in book 2, 522-68; it is a position which he is more or less forced to adopt,
since he has already argued that the total number of atoms is infinite (1, 1008-51),
while the number of atomic shapes is limited (2, 478-521). Polignac agrees with
Lucretius that the number of atomic shapes is limited; on the other hand he criticises
him for viewing this as simply a part of the nature of things evidenced by the limit to
the appearance of new forms, referring it rather to the purposeful operation of Mind.
The other Lucretian argument against an infinite number of atomic shapes—that
because the shape of the atom is determined by the arrangement of the minimae partes
which compose it, too great a variety of atomic shapes would entail the possibility of
an atom large enough to see (2, 478-99>-is completely ignored by Polignac.
