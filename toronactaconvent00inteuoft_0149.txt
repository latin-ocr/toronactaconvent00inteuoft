Rom-:RT SIDER 131

and separated for the task of preaching the gospel” (⁴‘segregatus” 554ss
[1516]). Erasmus returns to the artifice of ethos in an annotation near the
end of the Epistle. He sees Rom. 15:18 as a “little preface‘’ to Paul's
narrative of his exploits in the proclamation of the gospel from Jerusalem
to Illyrium. This “preface” is added, he notes, to win the reader’s confi-
dence, and to obviate the charge of arrogance otherwise invited by the
bold account of Paul's deeds in 15:18-19 (“non enim'' 647F [1516]).

Erasmus seems well aware of the subtle assessments made by the author
of a letter about both himself and his addressee, and repeatedly shows
how Paul artfully modifies his language to accommodate Roman self-
esteem and to avoid a sense of hauteur. Rom. 1:11-12 is a case in point.
Paul had said that he wished to impart a spiritual gift to the Romans to
strengthen them, but he immediately adds a mitigating qualification: he
meant rather that they should find comfort among themselves, or, if one
prefers a stronger reading, that he and they should be mutually comfort-
ed. “The Apostle feared that he might offend the Romans with their
somewhat arrogant disposition if they appeared to need strengthening, as
though they were vacillating or wavering. Thus he explains this strengthen·
ing as ‘mutual comfort,’ speaking, as usual, with the greatest modesty‘’
(“simul’' 560F-6113 [1516]). In the 1519 edition Erasmus shows how Paul
again, near the end of the epistle, carefully shapes his language in a way
that reveals his sensitivity to Roman sels-perception. The pronoun αὐτοῑ
of Rom. 15:14, he argues, is artfully included, creating an emphasis which
reflects Paul’s recognition that the Romans did not need his admonition,
for they were able to admonish themselves (“ita ut'’ 647D).⁵

The examples above come for the first two editions, and belong to the
“frame,” so to speak, of the epistle. ln the last two editions Erasmus’
observations on the literary artifice by which ethos is established are
significantly more pervasive and emphatic. In 1527 he developed the
annotation just considered by appealing to Chrysostom‚ who had, he says,
“noted the steps by which the Apostle had softened and modified his
expression: First he said ‘strengthen,’ then, fearing the proud Romans
would say, ‘Whatl are we weak?' . . . he softened the expression and [spoke
of] comfort. . . . Finally he added the notion of a ‘common' faith laying
aside the mask of teacher and assuming that of a fellow disciple’‘ (“simul'’

⁵ Cf. Peter Abelard's Commentavy on Romans (PL l78.787c-88D‚ 79SB-C, 79813,
966C) where the elements of ethos in these verses are noted3 also the Glossa ordinaria

(Paris, 1590, vol. 6). Erasmus' notes, however, are striking for the manner in which
they reveal his sense of the conscious artistry in the text.
