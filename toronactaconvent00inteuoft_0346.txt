322 LITERARY Hvsslumlec IN THE RENAISSANCE

reason. Should the reader resist the urge to play the part of orator, he
may read this work as a spectator watches a drama and react to the
interplay of the characters. On yet another level, considering the final
cause of the oration’s function: to convince the reader of the necessity for
peace and persuade him to engage in the lofty pursuits for which peace is a
condition, the latter may well filter out the theatrics of the literary instance
and focus his attention on the argument. He is thus, like Charles and Henri,
receptor of the speech’s message as long as he is moved by the arguments,
and is most likely to be this kind of Pathos on second or third reading.

It is evident that manipulation of the oration of such a radical kind
does indeed deprive the text of its generic identity. No longer recogniz-
able as the text of an oratorical instance, it has become, thanks to printing
and publication, that of a literary instance which the reader may experi—
ence in a variety of ways as he pleases. The product of this combining of
generic elements can no longer be distinguished as one genre onto which
parts of another will have been grafted, but a genre unto itself‚ a true
hybrid, the product of a creative act.

And so, the Cohonatio, by demonstrating that pure Ciceronian classicism
can be creative, constitutes an incentive to contemporary humanist writers to
imitate the ancients, but with at least this kind of freedom and originality.
However, creativity has its pn'ce and, consciously or not, the creation of a
new genre not traceable to Classical antecedents ipso sacto called into question
the validity of rhetorical norms in its case. Peletier‚ of course, adhered to
those norms with the utmost n'gour, but was it necessary? Future writers,
following his example would be free to develop the genre for like purposes
of social commentary by elaborating on one or another of its parts: charac-
terization, situation, personal relationships or modes of expression.

But let us not slip into the trap of hagiography here: hybridizing is not
the exclusive invention or domain of jacques Peletier du Mans. There
were after all Utopias and Praises of Folly, religious polemics and various
other examples which readily come to mind. In the main, the thrust of
Renaissance writing was not after all retrogressive but innovative as the
subsequent evolution of vernacular literature proves. Freedom from
normative rhetoric would inevitably follow from this and other kinds of
neoclassicizing activities: the art of free composition in poetry, of free
narrative in the novel and, much later, in cinema.

I should like to point out in passing that this phenomenon of hybridiz-
ing also effectively contributed to the rejoining of the classical and classi-
cizing current of French literature and that of the Middle Ages whose
genres had other sources of inspiration‚ those of ancient celtic and ger-
manie mythology, and other norms of invention, disposition and delivery.
