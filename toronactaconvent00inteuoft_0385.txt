consideration, and came up with these forty-five of disputed origin. Since
Vinet and Scaliger were working on an almost virgin text, it is only to be
expected that some of the manuscript’s errors would receive their obvious
resolutions from both critics. Many of the emendations they share are
trivial, the sort of thing that any competent Latinist could provide immedi-
ately: about a third fall into this category. About half of the emendations
fall into a further category of “easy,” the sort of thing that a competent
Latinist could provide fairly quickly. Itis of course sometimes easy to spot
a mistake but much harder to see a satisfactory correction; and it is also
easy, with hindsight, to underestimate the difficulty of spotting an error,
except where a violation of metre is concerned. But if anything 1 have
been conservative in my assessment of these emendations.

That leaves half a dozen emendations common to both scholars. They
are: Protrept. 51 ecquando for various readings of VPHZ; Par. 4:25flesti for
fletu (V ); Par. 1328 sauciis for sociis (V); Pros. 21:27 deceret for doceret (V );
Ecl. 1323 dicat alta for dicata (V ); Mos. 438 Vivisca for vimfica of all manu-
scripts. These are not in any way exceptional, though in some cases it
must be said that additional corruption complicates the matter. They are
good but not brilliant. The best of them is Vivisca in Mos. 438. The word
vivifica makes a sort of sense—early scholars accepted and attempted to
explain things much worse—and is grammatically and metrically accept-
able. But the word Vivisca, which is certainly right, is commended on
literary, palaeographical and topographical grounds. Not many of us, 1
suppose, carry in our heads the knowledge that Bordeaux was the capital
of the Bituriges Vivisci; but Scaliger and Vinet were not only local men,
they were also keen antiquarians, and so either of them might have
divined this correction. We happen to know in this one case (from Vinet,
not Scaliger) that Vinet thought of it first, but if we did not, then we
might fairly conclude that both men had arrived at it independently.

The purpose of this brief analysis has not been to evaluate the work of
Scaliger and Vinet on the text but to try to facilitate the attribution of the
disputed emendations. I cannot say that there are any of such brilliance
that they compel the conclusion that they could not have been made
independently. It would be quite easy to believe that most of them did
occur independently to both scholars. And it does not seem possible to
assert that some of them bear the characteristic imprint of one or the
other—as one might venture in the case of certain other scholars, such as
Heinsius, the third great benefactor of the text of Ausonius.

The problem remains therefore, and a solution must be given on the
basis of the circumstantial evidence. It seems very likely that Scaliger saw
some or perhaps all of Vinet's emendations and then used them more or
