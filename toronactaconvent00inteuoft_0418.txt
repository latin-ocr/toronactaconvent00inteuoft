594 THE ANTr-LUCRETIUS OF MELcnloR DE POLIGNAC

mathematicians Thomas Hariot, Walter Warner, and Nicholas Hill, the
author of the first, if confused, account of classical atomism in English, the
Philosophia Epicurea, Democritiana, Theophrastica of 16013 the “Newcastle
circle‚” a small group of English emigres under the patronage of William
Cavendish in Paris during the 1640s, numbering among them, William
Petty‚ Kenelm Digby, and Lady Margaret Cavendish; Dr.Walter Charleton,
scholar of Oxford and physician to Charles Ι, whose solid reputation as a
High Churchman gave acceptance to his Physiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-
Charletoniana of 1654, a translation and adaptation of the atomistic
writings of Pierre Gassendi; the French scientist Gassendi himself, whose
grand synthesis of Epicurean philosophy in the Animadversiones in Decimum
Librum Diogenis Laertii (1649) and the Syntagma Philosophicum (1658)
established atomism as a serious rival to Cartesianism; in Italy, Sebastion
Basso, Claude Berigard, andJean Chrysostome Magnen; and in Germany,
Daniel Sennert and Joachim Junge.

It is in the nature of a debate, of course, that there be at least two
sides, and it is certainly the case that the promoters of atomism had not
gone unchallenged—by supporters of the Aristotelian concept of substan·
tial forms, by university men who saw in the ‘new science' and its adoption
by the majority of members of the newly formed Royal Society a challenge
to their authority, and by staunch churchmen who feared for the integrity
of established religion. Melchior de Polignac was last in a line. A devout
member of the Catholic church he was convinced that the classica! atom-
ism resurrected by its modern defenders was inseparable from its Epicure-
an parent and synonymous with the rejection of a deity, the denial of the
immortality of the soul, and the glorification of sensuality as the end of
living. If its defeat required a refutation of the new physics, he was pre-
pared to accept the challenge.

Polignac was born of distinguished ancestry at Puy-en-Velay in southern
France in 1661, and after an education at the Jesuit College of Clermont
and the Sorbonne he became a cleric at the court of Louis XIV, and
began a long career as a dignitary of the Church and diplomat in the
service of France. From 1693-97 he served the court as Ambassador to
Poland, and in 1716 was appointed Auditeur de Rote at Rome. He repre-
sented France at the Congress of Gertruydenberg in 1710 and at the
Council of Utrecht in 1713. In the same year he was appointed Master of
Music at the Chapel Royal and made Baron of Versailles and Cardinal of
the Church. Following a temporary exile at his abbey at Bonport he spent
the years 1724-32 as Minister de la Paupite in Rome where he assisted at
the election of three popes. Well connected at the French court he
numbered Mme. Pompadour, Voltaire, and Fontenelle among his close
