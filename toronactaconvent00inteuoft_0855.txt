MICHAEL zAPPALA 829

Turkish lands contradicts the radical irenicism of the first hals of the work.
Scipio explicitly crin’cizes the anti-glory stance of Minos when he notes that
“ingens nomen’' was something that “meo quidem tempore gloriosum in
primis ac praedimndum censebatur‘' (479).

Though some of Scipio's positions coincide with those of the discredit-
ed speakers, his allusion to his own considerable experience, a powerful
source of captatio, his disinterested prag-matism and the concreteness of
his proposals in the face of a pressing problem invite the reader's belief.

The Roman's political agenda creates its own discourse. The antitheses,
fused as identities in the speech of Minos and Tiresias, are restored as
polarities. Asiatics (“meticulosos homines et bello minime idoneos”) and
Europeans (“animo ac viribus praestantiores'') are presented as clearly
distinguished geographica] and moral groups (477). Not only are the
Asians “worse,” they are profoundly “other.” Scipio urges the Christians
to fight “contra homines alienissimos, procul dissitos, hostes religioni suae
ac nominis” (473). The prominent antitheses of Scipio's speech and the
use of verbal strategies such as anteoccupatio to discount other viewpoints
make the general’s discourse a notable exception to the discursive “open-
ness” of the rest of the work.

These two world views and their related discourses touch only tangen—
tially in the work. The first half of the dialogue treats only part of the
title—De dissidiis Eumpae— and presents through Minos and Tiresias an
irenic critique of politics in Christian Europe. Scipio's speech addresses
only the second half of the title—De bello turcico-and largely parenthesizes
the value system of Minos and Tiresias.

Is Vives arguing for an excision of idealism and pragmatism? In view of
Scipio’s closing remarks, apparently not. The general, having stated the
benefits of glory and conquest—and the evangelization of new peoples—
expresses a single, critical, doubt which though marking the space between
his program and the Christian ideal also provides a point of contact:
“Nescio an idem Christo videatur, sed certe hoc tolerabilius malum quam
furor ille civilis dissidii” (479).

Tiresias’s response to Scipio is surprisingly oblique. He replies only that
evangelization should be carried out “non vi aut armis'' (479). While
Tiresias’s comment is not surprising in view of Vives's preoccupation with
conversion as member of a converso family, it is unusual that the seer
should pass over in silence the numerous discrepancies between Scipio's
advice and his own. Indeed, only when Minos urges Tiresias to provide his
solution to the Turkish problem does the seer furnish a plan which in turn
parenthesizes Scipio’s proposed invasion. For Tiresias, the only strength of
Christians is “Christi . . . tutela” (480). Christ’s protection is “inexpug-
