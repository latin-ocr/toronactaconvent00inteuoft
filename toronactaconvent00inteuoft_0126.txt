ation can be carried forward with the valuable work of August Buck on
the commentary in the Renaissance.³²

What is manifest, I trust, is that sixteenth-century biographers of
Thomas More had a rich thesaurus of models, topoi, and lore from which
to draw: rhetorical conventions of description, new developments in the
writing of lives of religious men and women and now the writing of the
lives of devoted lay men and women, new efforts to see literary works in
historical context, and, perhaps most of all, a new urgency that derived
from the tensions and challenges of the Reformation and Counter-Refor·
mation. At some future date we shall want to compare lives of Luther and
other reformers, or Foxe’s Book ofMartyrs, more intensively with Roman
Catholic biographical writings—and the new vernacular with the more
traditional Latin. But that must remain a rather distant task. What is
necessary first is to examine to what extent the very nature of tradition
and the viability of old conventions came into question, not unlike the
challenging of tradition in our own post-modernist world.³³

saw Sallust's prooemium as a locus for historica] style, they described the
prooemium in rhetorical terms which focused on the orator-historian, they
emphasized Sallust’s ‘brevitas’ and they both were interested in the correct
stylistic use of digressions.

I quote from Blackwell, “Humanism and Politics,” 435. See Sallust, Bellum Caudinum,
cum commento L. Valli (Venice, 1492), sig. a. ii.

³³ Ι am aware that the assertion of a continuum, or the affirmation of tradition, is
itself a critical (and even a political and theological) statement: see my “Erasmus in

England, 1499-1517: Translatio studii and the Studia humanitatis,” Classical and Modern
Literature 7 (1987); 269-83-repr. in Erasmus Grandescem (Nieuwkoop: DeGraaf, 1988).

Perhaps in a post—modernist world what will be needed will be contrastive, rather
than comparative, approaches.
