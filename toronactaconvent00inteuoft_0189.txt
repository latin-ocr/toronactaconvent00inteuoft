A Spinozistic Perspective
on the Jephthah Tragedies
by George But-hanan (c.1643)
andJoost van den Vondel (1659)

FOKKE AKKERMAN

l t would appear that of the many dramatic treatments of the Jephthah
theme in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries only Vondel’s “treur—
spel'’ Jeptha ⁰s offerbelofle is to all intents an imitatio of Buchanan's “tra-
goedia” Iephthes sive votum. That Vondel wanted it to be just that, appears
from the title of his drama, which is a literal translation of Buchanan's,
from Vondel's praise and criticism of Buchanan’s play immediately in the
opening section of his theoretical preface, from dozens of lines that have
been translated di rectly by Vondel from the Scotsman’s text, and from the
whole structure of the play. Vondel borrowed all his main characters from
Buchanan; both poets concentrated on the vow and the sacrifice; neither
of them has included the negotations betweenJephthah and his brothers,
or those between Jephthah and the Ammonites, in the dramatic action;
neither poet has introduced a lover for the daughter, or thought fit to
insert comic scenes to 0amuse the audience. Both poets had the firm
intention to bring an ideal tragedy in the Greek manner on the stage.¹
