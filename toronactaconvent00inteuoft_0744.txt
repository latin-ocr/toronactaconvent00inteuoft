718 GROTIUS AND LEGAL TRADITION

very persuasive. But there is in Roman law the same general principle (D
2‚l4,39)‚ the reason for it being that the maker of an obscure agreement
could have made it clear by a more careful choice of words, so that the
risk of misunderstanding falls on him.

I have referred to some of Grotius’s notes mentioning sources. Legal
literature is famous for mentioning sources, but usually they are profes-
sional ones, that is, texts in the corpus of civil law, canon law, glossators,
or commentators. It is striking that in this one chapter there are no fewer
than 150 citations, supplied by Grotius himself either in marginalia or in
footnotes; of these only fifty-two refer to professional legal literature, and
only twelve mention specific civil or canon law texts.⁸ In some places he
quotes or paraphrases these texts without mentioning their origin.⁹

In the methodological statement which I quoted from Grotius’s earlier
work he takes the view that the only criterion available for settling interna-
tional disputes is natural reason, and that therefore the appeal to Roman
law is not appropriate. And Ι have noted his rejection of Roman law at the
end of the later work. But he asserts that the method of drawing legal
wisdom from the fount of nature, from the heart of philosophy, is recom-
mended by “those jurists of antiquity whose names we revere,” and
according to his own note these are none other than the jurists whose
works are represented in Justinian’s Digest. He thus finds authority within
the legal tradition itself for the idea that he should form his own opinions
independently of the legal tradition. There is some truth in this idea,
certainly, if one believes that the heart of philosophy is also the heart of
jurisprudence. What is odd about Grotius is that after having announced
that he was going to recreate jurisprudence on the basis of natural reason
he only reiterates in a rather sketchy way the main outlines of a doctrine
which was well developed and exhaustively discussed by jurists and com-
mentators centuries before. And it is not clear that he has discovered any
new or more persuasive reasons for adhering to the principles laid down.

⁸ Apart from the professional literature (Corpus iuris civilis, Corpus iuris canonici,
glossators and commentators)‚ Grotius cites Aristotle, Cicero, Isocrates, Livy, Horace,
Polybius, Thucydides, Polyaenus, Augustine‚ Servius, Tertullian, Frontinus, Plutarch,
Valerius Maximus, Homer, Procopius‚Justin, Demosthenes, Diodorus Siculus, Appian,
Dionysus of Halicarnassus, Ammianus, Menander Protector, Lucan, Quintilian,
Seneca, Pliny the Elder, Tacitus, Philo, Isaeus, Gellius, Donatus, and Ovid.

⁹ As an example, the sentence “For as in all things the absence of a single one of
the causes is sufficient to prevent the result, and all causes need to concur that the
effect may be produced . . .'' (421) contains a paraphrase of a well known maxim by
Paul (D 50,1,1): Regula est, quae rem quae est breviter enarret . .. et, ut ait Sabinus, quasi
causae coniectio est, quae simul cum in aliquo vitiata est, perdit officium suum.
