must have had a particular reason for doing so. But before we embark on
an investigation of this question, it will be useful to find out what, precise—
ly, Alberti intended to say.

Later in the first book of his treatise, Alberti tries, by means of
common-sense philosophy and mathematica] optics, to convince the
reader of the possibility of reducing the whole world, including man, to a
smaller scale without anybody noticing any difference, provided the
diminution be made proportionately for all objects. The reason is, so he says,
that the human being will always tend to judge his surroundings by measure-
ment, using his own body as his yardstick. At the end of the first book,
furthermore, Alberti instmcts the painter about how to produce in his
picture that kind of mini-world, by using the linear perspective construction.

The method of linear perspective had been practised by the Florentine
artists throughout the early decades of the century. It had been proved
valid, moreover, especially for the rendering of architectonic prospects of
real buildings, thanks to the experiment made as early as 1420 by the
architect Filippo Brunelleschi, to whom Alberti was, eventually, to dedicate
the Italian version of his treaties.⁷ At this point it is worth noticing that
what Alberti had in mind with his perspective construction was neither
such an architectura! device nor the kind of illusionism for which linear
perspective was so widely explored in the following centun‘es. The mini-
world to be made by the artist was not to be simply a reorganization or
extension of the world proper of the beholder. Far more, it had to be
another world to be observed by him behind the frame of the picture, as
if looked at through an open windOW, as Alberti himself puts it in para-
graph 19. In other words, a sharp boundary between the world of the
beholder and that of the picture had to be drawn in order to safeguard
the moral implications of the latter as representing a higher state of value
compared to that of the beholder and not to be rivalled by him, but to
impress, instead, itself upon his mind.

To describe the process of construction in question, Alberti, in his
Italian text, naturally turned to a term current in the actual discussion of
the humanist circle to which he belonged. In Florence a literary debate on
the nature of poetic creation had been going on for a long time. Whereas
at the threshold of the fourteenth century, Dante in his Divine Comedy had
maintained that poetry was what he called a bella menzogna, Giovanni

Bocaccio, half a century later, had been of a slightly different opinion.
And so was, decidedly, Coluccio Salutati. In his De laboribus Hermus,
