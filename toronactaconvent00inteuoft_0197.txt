ness as a suitable subject for rhetorical drama, Vondel's tragedy assumes
melodramatic features. The dilemma of its hero may be real, butJephthah
fails to win our sympathetic understanding‚ perhaps because we have too
much sympathy for the reactions of his environment (Filopaie, Iphis, the
priests). And, on the other hand, the poet does not allow us to take sides
against his protagonist for other reasons than the sacrifice, as we do in the
case of Euripides’ Iphigenia in Aulis against Agamemnon, or, at least in the
fifth episode, against Buchanan’s jephthah. The natural coincidence of
subject matter and topical meaning as it is seen in Buchanan’s Iephthes, has
gone lost in Vondel. Neither in his preface, which is entirely devoted to
the writing of tragedy, nor in the play itself do any original religious or
philosophica] insights appear. Above all Vondel was ambitiously intent on
constructing an ideal tragedy according to all poetical precepts he could
lay hands on.¹⁵ He wanted the play to serve as a model for future gener-
ations of poets. In this respect too he was trying to supplant Buchanan’s
Iephthes. But in the actual result of his efforts there is also much of the
popular drama: emotional outbursts, sensation, sex and violence. For the
lasting succes of his art Vondel depended on large and mixed audiences.
As a newspaper critic phrases it: “Vondel certainly wanted to edify the
people, but at the same time mother needed her due share of crying.”¹⁶

¹⁵ In his preface Vondel mentions first Aristotle, then Vossius, quoting an oral
communication concerning Buchanan’s trespassing upon the Bible, Aristode again,
next Ronsard on the use of “vers commun” (Presace de anciade, 1587). Finally, he
enumerates the authors on poetics he has read and reread: Aristotle, Horace and their
interpreters and commentators: Robertellus (Francesco Robortello, 1516-67: In librum
Aristotelis de arte poetica explicationes, 1548); Madius, Lombardus (Vinccnzo Maggi, died
probably in 1564, and Bartolommeo Lombardi: In Aristotelis librum de poetica commum
aplicmiones, containing also an in Horatii librum de arte poetica interpretatio, 1550);
Scaliger (Julius Caesar Soeliger, 1484-1558: Poetioes libri septem, 1561); Heinsius (Daniel
Heinsius, 1580-1655: De tragoediae constitutione, 1611); Huigh de Groot (Hugo Grotius,
1583-1645: Preface to his translation of Euripides' Phoenissae, 1630); Castelvetro
(Ludovico Castelvetro, 1505-71: Poetica d'Aristotele vulgar-izzata et spana, 1570); Delrius
(Martinus Antonius Delrio, 1551-1608: Syntagma tragoediae latinae, 1593-94); Strada
(Famiano Str-ada, 1572-16492121v1miones Academicae, 1627); Vossius (GerardusJoannes
Vossius, 1577-1649: Poeticae Institutionae, 1647); Menardieres (Hippolyte-Jules Pilet de
la Mesnardieres, 1610-63: Poe‘tique, 1639). Vondel also mentions the composer
Orlando di Lasso (1532-94) to indicate the level of competence needed for the
director of choir and musicians.
