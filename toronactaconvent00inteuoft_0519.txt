ly she drew back from the advanced positions taken by contemporary
women whose writings she admired: Lucretia Marinella of Venice, who
had written La Nobiltcz e I’Excellenza delle Donne con difflui e mancamenti di
gli huomini, and her friend by correspondence Marie de Jars de Gournay,
who in France had written De l’Egalite des Hommes et des Femmes. She first
published her tract in 1641, Dissertatio de Ingenii Muliebris ad Doctrinam ἐν’
Meliores Literas Aptitudine, moderating her tone and her content to meet
Rivetus's objections, which she knew others would argue against her, and
she included her exchanges with Rivetus in the same volume, issue by
Elzevir of Leiden.

She set it up in the format of a university disputation of that age, as an
exercise in logic, defining subject and predicate, major premise and
minor, fourteen arguments in favor, followed by refutation of five objec-
tions. She poses a Problema Praeticum: Num Foeminoe Christiana» Convenit
Studium Literarum, which may be properly interpreted as “Is advanced
education consistent with the role of women as conceived by the Church
in the Netherlands.”

In the study of letters Anna Maria van Schurman includes “all disci-
plines'’: languages, history, grammar, logie, rhetoric, physics and meta-
physics, mathematics, music and poetry, Hebrew and Greek for the Scrip-
tures. Pathetically, she makes many concessions: not all women are equally
capable, not all women are equally free from burdensome family responsi·
bilities, or able to draw on adequate family resources. If only women will
at least be admitted to the world of culture, she will not insist on training
women in the arts of forensic jurisprudence, or in military strategy‚ nor
seek to have them prepared for preaching in the temple, arguing in court,
lecturing in the university and politics in general.

Her arguments follow the a priori patterns of the university logicians:
women have the potential, women desire learning, women need more
solid activity, learning makes for love of God and greatness of soul,
learning teaches reverence and arms against seductive heresies, ignorance
is simply not fitting for women. In the same format she rebuts objections:
women’s intellectis too feeble (she cites mediocrities among male gradu-
ates)‚ women's mind does not incline to study, facilities are lacking, higher
learning is not suited to women's “vocation.'’ Each objection is answered
in terms of formal logic, major and minor premise in turn, the way degree
candidates used to argue in those days. And still realistically confronting the
conditions of her time, she pleads: if the universities will not open their
doors‚ at least parents should take responsibility and provide private tutors
at home. So she rests her case, having meanwhile cited in support texts from
Aristotle and Plato and Nazianzenus and the Christian Scriptures in their
