Thomas Stapleton's Use of
More 's English Works (1557)
in his Vita Thomae Mori (1588)

GERMAIN MARc‘HADoUR

ln his preface to Vita et illustre martyrium Thomae Mori‚¹ Stapleton
tells us that he was born in July 1535, the very month of More’s birth
into eternal light. Writing in 1588, he is exactly the age at which More lost
his father (1530): as More on that occasion suddenly felt old, Stapleton
too senses the onset of old age: “me senio jam appetente.” In the three
decades since he left England rather than accept Elizabeth as supreme
head of the English church, he had published as enormous amount: first
a million words of English while a theology student at louvain, and
several millions in Latin after losing hope of England's foreseeable return
to the Roman unity of the church.

¹ The third panel of Stapleton’s Tres Thomae, the other Thomases being the
Apostle and Becket. The book was published at Douai in 1588 and was often reprinted
by itself or in Stapleton's Opera omnia. The Frankfurt edition of 1689, retitled Vita et
obitus Thomae Mori (no doubt to avoid prejudging More's martyrdom) is available in
a Minerva reprint of 1964. The first English translation, by Msgr. Phillip E. Hallett,
published as The szfe and Illustrious Manyrdom of Sir Thomas More (London, 1928) was
edited by E. E. Reynolds with annotations and an excellent introduction (London,
1966). This edition is available in the reprint by Fordham University Press (New York
and London, 1984).

The only book-length monograph on Stapleton is Marvin R. O’Connell’s Thomas
stapleton and the Counter Reformation (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964). 1 know
of only one unpublished Ph.D. dissertation on his life of More: that of Sr. Mary
Celestine Cepress intitled “Thomas Stapleton’s Vita Mori: A Critjcal Analysis and
History” (Catholic University of America, Washington DC, 1952). Other relevant
material can be found in my article “Tres Thomas“ in Proceedings ο] the PMR Conserenoe
(1985), vol. 10 (Villanova, 1987), 23-40.
