shores on the Caspian were carried through an underground channel and
could be observed floating on the surface of the Persian Gulf. Father Avril
reasons:

But Ι have two Conjectures which make me believe, that it rather
discharges it sels into the Persian Gulph, how far remote soever it
may seem to be, then into any other Sea.

The first is, because that in the Gulph of the Persian Sea, to the
South, over against the Province of Kilan, there are two dangerous
Whirlypools, or deep Abysses‚ which the Persian vessels that set Sail
from that Coast, endeavour to avoid as much as they can. And the
noise of the Water, which throws it sels into that Gulph with a sur-
pn‘zing Rapidness, may be heard in calm Weather‚ so far off, that it
is enough to terrify all those who are ignorant of the real Cause. The
second Conjecture, which to me seems to be of more force then the
former is grounded upon every years experience, by which they who
inhabit all along the Persian Gulph, observe a vast quantity of Wil-
low—leaves at the end of every Autumn. Now in regard this sort of
Tree is altogether unknown in the Southern Part of Persia, which
borders upon that Sea; and for that, quite the contrary, the North-
ern part which is bounded by the Sea of Kilan, has all the Sea-coasts
of it shaded with those Trees; we may assure our selves with proba-
bility enough, that these Leaves are not carry’d from one end of the
Empire to the other, but only by the Water that rowles 'em along
th'rough the Caverns of the Earth.2

Such was the prevailing solution, apparently supported by eyewitness
testimony, during the latter part of the seventeenth century. But in the
year 1683 the Swedish Embassy from Charles XI to the Shah of Persia left
Stockholm and traveled through Russia on its way to Isfahan. Among
those members of the delegation empowered to conduct trade negotia-
tions was its secretary, Engelbert Kaempfer, the German scholar and
scientist. Kaempfer was just beginning what would prove to be a most
extraordinary journey of scholarship and science lasting a decade and
including Russia, Persia, India, the East Indies, Siam, and Japan.³ Dr.

² Reverend Philippe Avril, aJesuit missionary, attempted to reach China. He left
Europe in 1685, but was detained by the governor of Astrachan and forced to return
to France. See Voyagoe en divers Etats d'Europe et d’Asie (Paris, 1692). The above English
translation is taken from: TraveLs into divers Parts os Europe and Asia, Undenaken by the

French King's Order to discover a new Way by Laud into Chim . . . (London, 1693), 79—80.
