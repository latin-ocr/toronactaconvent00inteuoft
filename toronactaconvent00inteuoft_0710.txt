684 LATIN TERMs AND THEIR TRANSLATION

Officio Summarum Imperantium‚ which seems to call out for “sovereigns,’'
is translated “The duty of supreme governors” (which, 1 believe, is not
contemporary idiom in any school of thought). Barbeyrac, by contrast, in
dealing with the same chapters, has for the title of 2.7 “Des parties de la
souverainete en general'’; at 2.8.1 he uses “la souverainete''; and for the
title of 211 he has “Des devoirs du souverain.''

Once again, then, in a crucial area of terminology the twentieth century
translator is left to make the choice of how he will present his author. For
Pufendorf “sovereign'' seems to be appropriate for much the same
reasons as “state'’ is appropriate for civitas, because it seems to fit his
absolutism, his employment of civis and subditus as synonyms²² and be-
cause the English thinker closest to him, Hobbes, used “sovereign'’

jus and lex

A comparison of the treatment of jus and lex by Hobbes and Pufendorf
shows how little an author's own definition of a word may correspond to
general usage. In a well-known passage of Leviathan (l.l4) Hobbes says:
“Though they that speak of this subject use to confound jus and lex, right
and law, yet they ought to be distinguished; because RIGHT consisteth in
liberty to do, or to forbear: whereas LAW determineth, and bindeth to
one of them: so that laW‚ and right, differ as much as obligation and
liberty: which in one and the same matter are inconsistent.” Comparison
with Pufendorf and others shows this to be very much a “persuasive”
definition.

The distinction between jus as “right‘' (in a subjective sense) and lex as
“law'' does not figure prominently in classical usage. Though jus does
sometimes mean subjective “right'’ usually with reference to a legal right,
it more often means objective right or “law.'’²³ Indeed it is commonly
argued that the concept of subjective right which Hobbes wishes to signify

by jus did ¹¹⁰{4CXiSt in the classical world but developed during the later
Middle Ages.

²² The description of the general duties of the good citizen at De Officio 2.18.3-4
makes clear why there is no distinction between a citizen and a subject.

²³ In the sense of “law’' (e.g., Var. L. 5.l65) jus institutum a Pompilio . . . ut (porta)
sit apena; with a wider interchangeability of jus and lac Cic. Har. 32 si minus civili jure
perscriptum est, lege tamen naturae, communi jure gentium sanctum est.
