Printed Commonplace Book-5 in the Renaissance

ANN MOSS

Ι he existence of commonplace books in the Renaissance is common
knowledge. Access to the world of neo-Latin culture, that is to say

to the world of the educated elite in Early Modern Europe and its depen-
dencies, was gained through humanist educafion, and one of the most
characteristic features of humanist pedagogy was the commonplace book
every student reader of Greek and Latin literature was earnestly advised
to keep. The Lutheran schoolmaster David Chytraeus in his De Ratione
discendi of 1564 summarises almost a century of almost identjcal observa-
n'ons on the subject:

So that the more lustrous passages in the designated authors and
ornaments of discourse such as notable aphorisms, examples, simili-
tudes‚ words, phrases and figures may be the more easily imprinted
on the memory and available and ready for use as occasion requires,
it is extremely useful for students to have a book of commonplaces
arranged in a definite order, that is to say, in headings under which
they may transcribe everything worthy of recall out of what they hear
or read in their texts, apportioning their excerpted material to the
separate sections of their notebooks. In this way students will con-
struct an index to the major texts and a store-house from which to
draw an abundant array of excellent subject matter, aphorisms,
similitudes‚ exemplary narrations, etc„ whenever they are required
to speak or write on any matter. (Fol C 3 ν’)1

¹ I have deliberately chosen Chytraeus as a typical‚ not an original promoter of the
commonplace book. The advice on commonplace books given by more eminent
humanists, Vives, Erasmus, Melanchthon, Agricola, had already been collected since
the early 1530s in a volume De Ratione studii, reprinted several times in the middle
years of the century.
