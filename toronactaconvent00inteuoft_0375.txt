foulness. Characters, moreover‚ should conform to actual personages; and,
by drawing on the thought and temperaments of real individuals, the
writer incorporates individual characteristics into an illusion of truth.
Plato, he continues, violates this precept; for, as we learn from Athenaeus,
the elder Parmenides is far removed in age from the younger Socrates.
Cicero, on the other hand, selects Cato who, renowned for his oraton'cal
skills, expresses the subtlety of arguments as if he were alive and present.
Characters must assume the roles of confirming, teaching, refuting, and
listening, and thereby represent a particular stance. But Sigonius stresses
that the writer’s use of language goes beyond speech. The setting must
also complement the fictitious illusion. October 16th‚ for example, estab-
lishes a specific time for Cicero’s depiction of debate in his Tusculan
Disputations. And if discussion touches upon literature or philosophy, an
estate or rustic surroundings away from the distractions of work contrib—
ute to an expression of the verisimilar.

ΙΙΙ. Substance: Dialogue and Dialectics

Sigonius designates dialectical discourse as the subject matter of dialogue.
Accordingly, the structure of dialogue is bipartite: (l) a prologue serves as
an introduction; (2) the debate, like the narrative of a poem, contains the
substance of the work that examines the veracity of a thesis. The initial
statement defined in the prologue begins an orderly progression that leads
to a reasonable conclusion of the disputation. Sigonius, though, continues
to emphasize the importance of rhetorical tropes and techniques. In the
prologue, the reader must be informed of the proposition to be discussed;
but, like the orator attempting to capture the listener’s attention, the
dialogist softens the intellectual with the mundane. In Cicero‘s De divi-
natione, for example, an interlocutor asks a question in a restrained way,
whereas the history of rhetoric recounted in the Brutus begins indirectly
through a discussion of an unpaid literary debt. In each case, however, the
initial statement is expressed and elaborated through the employment of
sententiae and a description of customs.

The reference to the depiction of everyday happenings recalls the
remarks on decorum and verisimilitude. But Sigonius relates the word
sententia to Aristotle’s use of the term dianoia, which affords an opportuni-
ty to interrelate rhetorical and dialectical aspects of the dialogue. Like
Aristotle who sees rhetoric as the counterpart of dialectics (Rhetoric 1.1),
Sigonius insists on the role of argumentation as the substance of a poetic
genre that includes the resources of the orator. In criticizing previous arts
