“we do not count lying and deceit as despicable faults’‘ (de se et suis
Danis ait: Nos mentiri et fauere inter uitia sordesque non ducimus).²²
This unfortunate phrase runs as a red thread through the whole speech,
applied to all Danes of all times. Moreover, the speaker makes his own
frame of reference quite explicit: at the end of the long speech he com-
pares his task to that of Cicero, speaking against Verres, Catiline, and
Anthony.²³ Johannes Magnus also cannot resist the temptation to allude
to the famous beginning of Cicero's first speech against Catiline. Hem-
ming Gadh says somewhere: “My aim is, finally to stop the Danes abusing
our patience’' (me . . . moliri . .. quod Dani . . . tandem desinant nostra
patientia . . . abuti).²⁴ Saxo is here in very good humanist company.

As we have seen, soon after the appearance of the editio princeps Saxo
won a status almost comparable to a classical writer. His stylistic qualities
combined with his glowing patn’otism made him an unexpected trump
card for Denmark when the other n'valling states of Europe had to engage
humanists to produce patriotic history.

”Johannes Magnus, op. cit„ p. 754. In fact Saxo makes a distinction between his
own time and the heroic old days: he writes, a propos an isolated dubious character
(a Swede) in Book IV (4, 10, 1 p. 102, 13 OlriklRaeder): “Crediderim nostri temporis
mores huius uiri auspiciis inchoatos, qui mentiri ac fallere inter uitia sordesque non
ducimus.”

²'’Johannes Magnus, op. cit„ p. 776: “Nec me quisquam quasi nimis prolixa ora-
tione utentem increpet: sed ad memoriam reuocet Romanum Ciceronem, qui multo
extensioribus actionibus in unum Verrem, atque alterum Catilinam usus fuisse pro-
batur, totque Philippicas in solum M. Antonium exaggerat. Ego autem cum innumera-
bilibus Versibus, et Catilinis, Antoniisque adeo ingens bellum assumpsi, ut” eqs.

nostra?”
