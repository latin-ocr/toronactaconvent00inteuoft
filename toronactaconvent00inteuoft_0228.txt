204 MULCASTER AND MERCURIALE

As one may well imagine, the author's double approach to each of his
sports does not provide the book with much continuity. As Jacques
Ulmann‚ the historian of sports, sayS, “preoccupations medicales et
historiques interferent.’'⁶ Yet the work is immensely learned with refer—
ences to at least 122 ancient authorities—principally Hippocrates, Galen,
Aristotle, Celsus, Oribasius, Aetius, as well as the Arabs Avicenna‚ Aver-
roes, and Rhazes. Mercuriale reads these sources critically, and often
places differing opinions side by side to allow the reader to see how sound
medical advice may be obtained through the weighing of apparently
contradictory authority.

We don't know how Mulcaster came across Mercuriale’s De arte
gymnastica, although we do know that for every topic in his Positions, not
just for sportS, he wished to support his arguments by reference to
up-to-date as well as classical authority. For instance, in preparation for a
never written section of his Elementarie on drawing and penmanship he
wrote to the celebrated cartographer Abraham Ortelius to ask him about
books on drawing and mentions that he had himself already looked at
Pliny, Vitruvius, and Diirer.⁷ No doubt he cast about in the same way for
material on sports. Yet how he got to the book is unknown, indeed even
which edition he followed.8

To get a precise idea of how Mulcaster used Mercuriale’s treatise‚ one
should set the two books side by side and read them together, and this is
what I shall now do for one part of the texts. Mulcaster’s chapter 21 “Of
Running” is based on those chapters “De cursu'' (2.10) and “De cursus
natura'’ (5.7) mentioned above. Mulcaster begins his little essay on run-

1977), 99; 97-114 on De arte gymnastica. Ulmann does not seem entirely sympathetic
to the historical project implicit in much of humanist thought, including its science.

⁸ After a fairly close comparison of the texts (runs of the editions are found in the
British Library and the Osler and Rare Book libraries of McGill University) 1 cannot
specify which of three possible editions he read. Besides the first edition of Venice
1569 there is a slightly revised and now illustrated edition of Venice 1573 also
published by the Giunta family and a reprint of Paris, 1577, published by Du Puys;
there is also an edition of 1601 (rpt. Rome: Banco di San Spirito, 1960; for the
accompanying translation, see note 5 above). On the woodcuts in 1573 and later
editions, see Harvard College Library Department of Printing and Graphic Arts,
