724 DANISH NEo-LATIN EPIC

Here Borch quotes Aeneas' description of Hector, who appeared to
Aeneas in a dream, shortly before the fan of Troy (Aen. 11.270-79):

in somnis, ecce, ante oculos maestissimus Hector . . .
raptatus bigis ut quondam, aterque cruento

puluere perque pedes traiectus lora tumentis.

ei mihi, qualis erat . . .

squalentem barbam et concretos sanguine crinis

uulneraque illa gerens, quae circum plurima muros
accepit patrios.

In the same way as Aeneas is surprised at Hector’s miserable appearance,
Charles is surprised at the sight of the badly injured GustaV. Both figures
appear in a wounded state as they looked at the moment of death.³ And
just like Aeneas, Charles only partially comprehends the fact that it is a
bad omen when this formerly great hero and fellow countryman suddenly
appears in such a pitiful state. Charles simply declares that only women
and children are scared by that kind of dream (Amag. 171-73):

Talibus at trepident puerilia pectora visis,

Effoetaeque nurus: non vana insomnia Regem
Terruerint. . . .

He does admit, however, that he was shaken by a strange chill (Amag.
181): Sed mihi nescio quid frigusculi in ossa penetrat—a phrase that recalls
Aeneas‘ account from the ominous beaches he arrives at right after his
ssight from Troy (Aen. 111.29-30): mihi frigidus horror] membra quatit
gelidusque coit formidine sanguis. But even this sign of warning is dis-
missed by the Swedish king. He proclaims confidently that the Danes shall
be conquered in any event (Amag. 182): Quidquid id est, Dano delebitur
omne cruore—echoing Laocoons foreboding pronunciation regarding the
Trojan horse (Aen. 11.49): quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentis.
Thus, in Charles' speech, we find a number of allusions to the vague
premonitions of imminent danger among the Trojans, before the fall of
Troy and during the ssight from the city. With this, the defeat of the
Swedes is alluded to, in this poem as in Laetus' Margaretica, by means of
the fall of Troy in the Aeneid.

Itis no coincidence that Charles is the same type of tyrant as Albrecht.
Borch has clearly copied his own Swedish scoundrel from Laetus' ΑΙ-

³ Borch’s words Lycio tumultu are almost certainly a reference to the battle of
Liitzen in 1632 where Gustav Adolf died.
