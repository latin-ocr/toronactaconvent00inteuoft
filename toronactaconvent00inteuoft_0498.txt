474 JoHANNEs MURMELLIUS’ SCOPARIUS

the critical apparatus of Bomer, range from unpublished letters to a great
variety of printed works of ancient, patristic, and Renaissance authors,
including Italian, Freneh, and German humanists. Murmellius had obvi-
ously been collecting and sifting his sources for some years.

The title of the collection was deliberately fashioned: Scoparius . . . in
barbariei propugnatores et osores humanitatis ex diversis illustrium virorum
scriptis ad iuvanda politioris literaturae studia comparatus; that is, “The
broom against the defenders of barbarism and enemies of humanism,
composed from the different writings of famous men, for the purpose of
assisting the study of literature.''¹⁶ The Scoparius was to be a useful tool
or instrument, a “broom” to sweep away the dirt and cobwebs of the
scholastic way of thinking that had so obscured the purity and cleanliness
of the schoolhouse. To insure that this intention was clear, Murmellius
had printed on the title page several lines from Plautus' Stichus: “Every-
thing must be tidied up. Bring some brooms here, and a long pole, too,
so that I could throw out the spiders' work entirely, condemn their
weaving, and discard all of their webs.”¹⁷ In the context of the Plautus
play, these lines were spoken by Pinacium, a servant ordering a house-
cleaning in preparation for the return of Epignomus. The point of the
analogy is evident: just as a thorough cleansing of the house was needed
for the happy return of Epignomus and his exotic treasures from the East,
so too is a thorough sweeping of the schoolhouse required for the proper
return of the gems of ancient wisdom to be found in the study of litera-
ture.

This humanistic intention is further established by a quotation taken
from the ancient philosopher Heraclitus, which Murmellius related in his
prefatory letter to his friends Stiive and Meppen.¹⁸ The line is based on
Heraclitus Fragment 74: “Here, too, are gods.'’¹⁹ Murmellius had read
the passage in Aristotle: “There is a story which tells how some visitors
once wished to meet Heraclitus, and when they entered and saw him in
the kitchen, warming himself at the stove‚ they hesitated; but Heraclitus
said, ‘Come in; don't be afraid; there are gods even here'.'’²⁰ Just as
