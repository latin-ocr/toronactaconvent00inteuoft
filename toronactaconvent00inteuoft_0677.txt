HUBERTUS SCHULTE HERBRUGGEN 653

IV Summary

Like any drama, Drury’s Mors may be viewed from different formal and
material angles. If led by Drury’s title, we view it, as it were, from the
point of death and his major manifestations in medieval and Renaissance
art and literature, the medieval allegory of the “Dance of Death” must
needs come into view. Within its history Drury’s Mors appears precisely at
the moment when the medieval notion of a grim and greedy Death‚ who
seizes popes, emperors and all other estates alike, and who snatches his
victims media in vita, is no longer prevalent. Partly through the Protestant
reformation (which, for its sphere, did away with popes) and partly
through the rise of the national state (which did away with emperors) that
traditional notion gave way. From the traditional serenity of church art
depicted on the walls of the choir or the cloister and from the high ranks
of poetry and the morality play, it had “sunk” (apparently between 1568
and 1680) to unassuming broadsides, peddled in the market square for
the entertainment of the masses (with the next step even fiarther down to
the world of car-icature lying only just behind the corner).

If, on the other hand, one takes the title in all its seriousness, it sug-
gests a stn'king contrast by juxtaposing fearful Death with playful comedy.
It thus puts death into its metaphysical relativity: if men’s destiny is eternal
life, then indeed, physical death is but transitory, is but a porta vitae, and
Christian belief triumphs in the resurrecting victory of Easter Sunday over
the gloom of Good Friday. Even in a counter reformation school drama
of somewhat modest literary qualities.
