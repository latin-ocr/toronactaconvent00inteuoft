MARlANNE PADE 567

delectare, which is also used of studia humanitatis. In the preface to the
Themistocles, where he wn‘tes about the studia humanitatis in general and
specifically about the study of history, he says the mind should enjoy the
reading of literature, that such studies are a pleasure, and as an example
he mentions Alexander and Caesar who were so attracted by the sweet
pleasure of reading that they used literature as a remedy against excessive
sorrow or lust.²⁷ He quotes Chrysoloras, who had said that the reader
should be allured by the enjoyability of the subject material.²⁸ The words
used are iocunditas, amoenitas, voluptas, allicere, and they occur repeatedly
when Guarino writes about literature. This quality of literature is closely
connected to diction and style, as is evident from the letter to Roberto
de’Rossi. His merits as a translator are that An‘stotle‚ who before was
coarse and ungraceful in Latin, now appeared in a sweet, ornate and
elegant style.²⁹

The humanists usually stressed that the historical writers furnished their
readers with examples to follow or examples to avoid, but although
Guarino no doubt agreed with that, he rarely states the point explicitly.
One passage where he does so is in the preface to the Lysander and Sulla.
Here Sulla is presented as a rare specimen of cruelty; in translating his
Vita, Guarino is imitating the ancient Spartans, who induced young boys
to sobriety by showing them the hideous sight of a drunken slave.³⁰ One
suspects that these rather harsh words are part of the ideological war
waged between the adherents of monarchical and republican government in
these years. Caesar, the great monarchical symbol, had been assailed by the
writers of republican Florence. In retum Gumino, educator of the prince

Augusti Caesaris eruditissimorum hominum testimonio probari licet, quos tanta
lectionis amoenitate allectos fuisse constat, ut omnem et voluptatis et molestiae
magnitudinem quottidiana illius admixtione condirent lenirentque.”
