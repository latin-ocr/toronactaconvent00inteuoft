Mors is a comedy. According to Aristotelian theory,³² comedy deals in
an amusing way with common, everyday characters (not heroes) in ordi·
nary situations (unlike those in tragedies), and according to Donatus33 it
contained van’ous dispositions of town-people being shown what is useful
in life and what has to be avoided. In the Middle Ages a comedy was seen
as a poem with a bad start and a happy ending, in the Renaissance as
serving a corrective and educational purpose and as giving pleasure and
entertainment at the same time. Drury's Mors Comoedia partakes of all such
notions.

It belongs to a genre of plays called school (or university) drama,
because they were written by scholars, performed by schoolboys or
students, acted before a school or college audience and, last but not least,
many of them were written in Latin, the lingua franca throughout the
western academic world. By the time of Drury, the genre had established
a tradition of its own, particularly in England, where performances of
Roman comedies (Terence and Plautus) were very popular. It could also
look back to early vernacular examples in England such as Ralph Roister
Doister (1553), a knockabout comedy following Roman models in unities,
plot and motivation or to Gammer Gurton's Needle, played at Christ's
College, Cambridge.

If, generally, the university drama pursued didactic purposes (fluency in
Latin, use of rhetoric, humaneness), the continental reformers, at the
instance of Luther and Melanchthon, placed such plays at the service of
religious controversy. The Jesuits soon followed suit. Their school drama
sought to inculcate moral virtues and to deter from vices which, in the age
of counter-reformation‚ included Lutheran heresy (in Mors, Act 111, vi,
Luther and the Devil are synonyms). By 1586, the Jesuit Ratio atque
Institutio Studiorum provided for the performance of Latin (later also
vernacular) tragedies and comedies, to be acted annually in all their
schools. As time went on, the plays became more and more ambitious‚
