The purpose of the publication is discussed in the introductory pieces.
The poems will secure immortalitas for the patron and his generous deeds.
They show Holzel's precipuam, et prope diuinam . . . modestiam, probitatem,
eruditionem, prudentiam, summamque benignitatem (Ricius, a3‘). They praise
him as being a famous poet and are by famous poets themselves (Sbrulius,
alv, vv. 1-2). They will be frequently read by Holzel’s friends (sub doctorum
uirorum oculos crebro reuocanda, et mihi et ceteris amicis, fictura communia,
Peutinger, a2'), reminding them of the love they felt for their patron (the
poems are amoris gratissima pignora, Peutinger, a2v).

We lack several facts which would be important for an evaluation of
Holzel’s position in respect to our collection. E. g.‚ who organized the
publication? Was it Bonomus? Or Holzel? Was the latter involved in the
publication in any way? Why had Bonomus this sudden urge to collect
poems about Holzel which had been neglected for years? Some of the
poems which had been sent to Holzel singly must have been known to
him previously.⁵ Had he collected any or all of them already?⁶

That our collection should be addressed to an Imperial counsellor, is

⁵ In the Augsburg municipal library there is a single printed sheet with some
epigrams by Celtis. The poet seems to have sent it to literary acquaintances; the
preserved copy has a handwritten dedication: Domino Blasio Patrono et prefecto fario
nostro semper memorando Conradus Celtis ac amicis omibus nostris Aulicis mittit. We may
imagine a similar use for some of our poems (cf. Ulsenius, f 3¹: Vlsenius pridem medicus
nunc carmina mittin Cadius, f 1¹: A me missa brevis tibi venit Epistola). The Celtis print
has been published by Dieter Wuttke, “Eine unbekannter Einblattdruck mit Celtis—
Epigrammen zu Ehren der Schultzheiligen von Osterreich,'' Arcadia 3 (1968):195-200.

⁶ In his letter to Holzel Bonomus remarks: Collectos igitur in unum corpus quosdam
nostrus illius temporis lusus s et que deinde ab amicis de te scripta comparare potuimus (a2‘).
That might suggest that the CBH are a more or less fortuitous collection of every
poem the editor could lay his hands on. This, however, is not so. Some of the
contributions were sollicited for the CBH (see n. 2 above). Furthermore, our collec-
tion is only a selection from a larger pool of poems to and about HolzeL some of
which were surely known to Bonomus. Of the two poems by Bonomus himself in the
oldest part of the cod. Oenipont. 664 only one found its way into the CBH: the first
part of the exchange between Bonomus and Holzel about a girl friend of the latter
(cl‘, see n. 35 below; the ms. has been edited in part by Antonius Zingerle, De
carminibus latinis saeculi XV. et XVI. ineditis, Beitriige zur Geschichte der Philologie, 1.
Theil [Innsbruck, 1880]). The version of this poem we find in the ms. (fol. 126&
Zingerle, no. 52) is obviously older. A second poem, pleading Holzel’s intervention
with the emperor on Bonomus' behalf for a grant of money (fol. l35'), was omitted
in the CBH (this poem was overlooked by Zingerle in his discussion of the contents
of the ms.: p. XXXIII). More poems dedioeted to Holzel are found in the second part
of the same ms. (see Zingerle, pp. XXXIV f.). Another poem is mentioned byJohanna
Felmayer, “Blasius Holzl: Eine markante Personlichkeit am Hofe Kaiser Mmcimilians,”
Tiroler Heimatbffiuen 37 (1962), 93-104, esp. p. 103 n. 1. See also n. 5 above.
