Prudentius,Jerome’s commentan'es, and Augustine's De doctrina christiam
(98-105). As a means of confirming those ancient and patristic authors,
Murmellius again relied on Italian and Northern humanists, especially
Giovanni Pico (90, 91, 117, 121), Agricola (93-96, 120), Reuchlin (107,
111-12), and Erasmus (108-10, 113-16).

Murmellius turned against the unlearned clergy (“indoctos sacerdotu—
los”) for his final criticism in the δωρον-ἕω. No doubt he had in mind the
same group of foolish priests, monks, and would-be teachers that was
satirized by the authors of the Epistolae obsmmmm virorum. Again, the
proof of their ignorance was their incorrect and barbarous use of gram-
mar (126). There is a selecu‘on from Filippo Beroaldo, warning that
ministers of the Church who speak in solecisms and barbarisms can only
but confuse the meaning of the holy Word (127). The corrective, Murmel-
lius suggests, is stated in the very canonica] decrees of the Church. He
listed a number of statements by early fathers and popes who promoted
a learned clergy (128). For instance, in addition to the prophets and
evangelists,Jerome approved the reading of Vergil and Terence. Murmel-
lius also affirmed Augustine, who suggests that the correct study of
language is prerequisite for a spiritual life (129). In a final poem and
salutation Murmellius argued that only through a more cultivated study of
literature will Chn‘stian students learn the correct approach to true
theology (“veram theologiam”) and to living a virtuous life (131).

In his orientation and arguments, then, Murmellius followed a long
tradition of Italian and German humanist defenses of poetry.²⁸ In keep-
ing with his earlier activities as a reform-minded teacher, headmaster, and
author, he collected a variety of ancient, patristic, and Renaissance sources
that supported his views on the need for basic educational changes.
Towards the end of his brief, but productive‚ career, Murmellius fashioned
selections from those sources, often tying them together with commentar-
ies of his own, to form a rather tightly woven argument. He intended this
instrument or tool to be used as a scoparius, a broom to sweep away the
filth and cobwebs that had so obscured the cleanliness of the schoolhouse,
just as the servant in Plautus' Stichus had pushed a broom to cleanse his
master's house. The six thematjc arguments of the Scoparius, like so many
