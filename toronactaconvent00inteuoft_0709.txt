Finally, Kennett translates the equivalent passage in De Jure Nature et
Gentium: “When this union of wills and of forces is once complete, thence
at last ariseth what we call a Commonwealth, or civil state, the strongest of
all moral persons, or societies.”²⁰ One notes that Kennett hedgeS‚ using
“Commonwealth, or civil state’' but following it up with “society.” In
other passages Kennett varies between “commonwealth'’ (e.g.‚ 7.l. l ), “civil
society’' (7.1 title), “civil state'' (7.2 title) and “community’' (7.l.4).

The problem for the translator of civitas, then, in a seventeenth century
text is to know to what tradition his author belongs and to choose his
translation of this keyword accordingly. It makes all the difference wheth-
er he chooses “state” or “civil society.'’

imperium and summum imperium

The translations offered for imperium and related phrases seem to
follow the same ideological lines as those for civitas. One may give a few
examples, though 1 have no space to work this out here. Imperium itself
usually comes out as “government'' or “power,'’ though the second
section of Hobbes's De Cive has “Dominion” as its title, where one might
have expected “government‚‘’ in contrast to the use of “Liberty” as the
title of the first part.

Summum imperium is particularly interesting. Hobbes uses “sovereign
power” freely along with “sovereign'' in Leviadzam however, the translator
of De Cive in dealing with summam potestatem, sive summum imperium sive
dominium in 5.11 gives “supreme power, or chiefe command, or domin-
ion.'’John Locke, however, in places where summum imperium would occur
in Latin, chooses “supreme power” and simply does not use “sovereign.''
Presumably this is a reflection of his opposition to absolutism and divine
right.²¹ Tooke in his translation of Pufendorf's De Officio Hominis et Civis
gives the title of 27 De Partibus Summi Imperii as “Of the several parts of
Government.” At 2.8.1 he translates summum imperium as “supreme
power,'’ and in general avoids “sovereign”; for instance, chapter 11 De
