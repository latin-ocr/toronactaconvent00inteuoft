782 JESUIT DRAMA

As an Anglicist‚ Ι wondered if any other subjects of English, Scottish, or
Irish history had been treated by the jesuits, wondered which subjects had
been the most popular and for what reasons they might have been adapt—
ed for college performances.

The following paper is the result of an analysis of bibliographies,
play-listS‚ and subject-catalogues of Jesuit-dramas, including the index
materiorum of Elida Maria Szarota's monumental edition of periochae, in
which two dozen plays dealing with British history are listed.³ The paper
is a preliminary survey of a fieldnof research which has proved to be far
greater and much more van'ed than I had expected after reading Szarota’s
article in honour of Leonard Forster.⁴ This is, however, only one reason
for the introductory character of the survey. The other reason is that some
of the apparently extant periochae could not be found and therefore could
not be analysed or compared with other texts on the same subject before
I had to finish this paper.

As may be seen from the following chronological list of plays, more
than a hundred and fifty plays dealing with English, Scottish, or Irish his-
tory were performed between 1594 and 1771 in about sixty different Con-
tinental Jesuit colleges. In view of the fact that particularly some minor
play-lists of the non-German-speaking provinces require further verifica-
tion, it is likely that the real number of plays is even higher. On the basis
of my experience with my project Thomas Morus Tragoedia, about which I
read a paper during the Wolfenbiittel Congress,⁵ Ι would assume that in
fact nearly two hundred Jesuit dramas dealt with English history in the
broadest sense of the word. If this assumption proves to be correct, Eng-
lish, Irish, or Scottish history was dealt with at least once a year in some
college.
