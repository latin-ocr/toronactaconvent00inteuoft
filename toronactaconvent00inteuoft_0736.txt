710 THE EMBLEMS OF CRANACH AND VAENIUS

Yet art is, after all, the transformation of rough nature into a civilized
form of expression which provides both instruction and pleasure for
humanity.

Vaenius's amusing emblem on the submission of Hercules to Love's
instruction in the arts echoes the earlier topos of “Hercules and Om-
phale” since the hero is pictured with a distaff. However, I believe that
this emblem is even more concerned with another popular topos of the
Renaissance, namely that of “Pleasure Reconciled with Virtue,’' which
derives in turn from the original “Choice of Hercules.'’¹⁷ The mature
Hercules finally recognizes (in Vaenius's version of the topos) that, al-
though Vice must be eschewed by the hero, Virtue and Pleasure should
not be always separated. As Mercury tells Hercules in Ben Jonson’s
masque of 1618, “Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue,'’¹⁸

The time's arrived that Atlas told thee of: how
By unaltered law, and working of the stars‚
There should be a cessation of all jars

'Twixt Virtue and her noted opposite

Pleasure (ll.l80-84)

Only through art and skill, however, can these opposites be joined in
harmony: “For what is noble should be sweet, s But not dissolved in
wantonness’' (ll. 299-300). Indeed, G. Karl Galinsky tells us that in Jon-
son’s masque, “Virtue and Pleasure cease to exist as ethical polarities but
are elegantly transformed into two different ways of life, the life of plea-
sure merely enhancing what virtue has to offer.'’¹⁹ Vaenius attempts a
similar harmonizing of nobility and sweetness in his emblem through the
conflation of “Hercules and Omphale” with the theme of “Pleasure
Reconciled with Virtue.'' Love and Hercules are now happily united
through the arts as an emblem of perfect concord.
