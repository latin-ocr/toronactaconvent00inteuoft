202 MULCASTER AND MERCURmLE

classical. Despite the remarkable attempt to argue for sports and the
principle of “a wise minde‚ and a healthfull bodie’' (p. 42), the chapters
seem curiously second-hand. An exception is the lively and anecdotal chapter
called “Of Shooting‘’; Mulcaster, like Roger Ascham, was a known enthusiast‚
a member of the famous knights of Pn’nce Arthur who annually gathered in
patriotic tribute to celebrate the traditional English long bow‚³ Yet he does
little justice to other sports, and his arguments for them seem pale.

There is an explanation for the thinness of his arguments, and he pro-
vides it himself near the end of the section on physical education. In
chapter 35 of Positions, almost in an aside, he says:

For the professed argument of the whole booke, Ι know not any
comparable to Hieronymus Mercurialis, a verie learned Italian Physi-
cian now in our time, which hath taken great paines to sift out of all
writers, what so ever concerneth the whole Gymnasticall and exercis-
ing argument, whose advice in this question I have my selfe much
used, where he did fit my purpose. (p. 128)

It turns out that most of his many pages on physical education are bor-
rowed, adapted from, or sometimes directly translated from the De arte
gymnastica libri sex by the Italian physician Girolamo Mercuriale. The
extent of Mulcaster’s debt was first analysed almost a hundred years ago
by Georg Schmid.⁴ Even so, few subsequent readers of Positions seem to

know that what they are reading is a digest and reorganization of a treatise
first published in Venice in 1569.

Girolamo Mercuriale was an almost exact contemporary of Mulcaster.⁵

Erziehung vom Ansang an bis aus unser-e Zeit, 5 vols. in 7 (Stuttgartz J. G. Cotta, 1884-
1902), (1892) 3: 373-76.

⁵ I have been unable to find any thorough modern study of Mercuriale. What
follows is based on Vincenzo Busacchi‚ “Girolamo Mercuriale nel 350⁰ anniversario
della morte‚‘' Romagna Medica 8 (1956): 417-30; the translator’s introduction to
Girolamo Mercuriale, Arte ginnastica, tr. Ippolito Galante (Romez Banco di San Spirito‚
1960), xix-xxvi3 the entry on Mercuriale in J.-F. Michaud, Biographie universelle, 2nd
rev· ed., 45 vols. (Paris: Delagrave et Cie.‚ n.d.); P. Paoletti, Gerolamo Mercuriale e il suo
tempo: Studio eseguilo su 62 lettere (Lancianoz Cooperativa Editoriale Tipografica, 1963).
On the contents of De arte gymnastico there are the two not entirely satisfactory articles
by W. Brunoni and by M. Terzi and W. Ronchi in the volume of Romagna Medica
above. There are also two curious attempts to turn Mercuriale into a precursor of the
Fascist doctrine of physical culture3 see Giuseppe Mazzini, Jemnimo Mercuriale
(1530-1606) y su “De Arte Gymnastica” (Sandago, Chile: Imprento “Cultura,” 1940)
