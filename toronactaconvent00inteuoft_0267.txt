is obvious. It appeam, besides, from echoes not in Luchetti that Vincent
went directly to the Roman comedy. For example, Lidonia’s proverbial
expression that water is not more similar to water than are the
twins—“Aqua aquae non est similior, quam hic est alteri’' (4496)—echoes
the Menaechmi: “neque aqua aquae usquam similius, l quam hic tui,
tuque huius autem'' (Plautus, ed. Paul Nixon, 5 vols. [Londonz Heine-
mann, 1917]‚ 2:478, lines 1089-90).

Although the outline of the Italian comedy‘s plot and its character-types
are transmitted in Vincent's adaptation, where Pan‘a is fleshed out it
becomes relentlessly Stuart English. Combining components of romance,
satire, and farce into something like Jacobean city comedy, Paria is distin-
guished by the resolute, social integration of its characters: jealous and
negligent young lovers whose Neoplatonic passions are finally gratified, a
liberal old father, a soldierly parasite whose boast to have rid the seas of
pirates for the benefit of merchants (a likely allusion to Charles’s contro-
versial naval policy) is not disputed (868—74), a wayward son who is not
really prodigal, a witty and honest innkeeper’s wife, an engagingly lustful
pedant, his aging (and poor) courtesan bride, a elever servant and a stupid
who both tn'umph, and even a wliining widow whose remarriage confirms
the union of a noble with a merchant family. In the resolution of this
comedy—in the marriages of Lidonia, Tiberius, and their children—the
King and his company were shown the convenience of liquid assets for the
fulfillment of gentle love, and thus the resolution of class conflicts (4983-
87), indeed, the admirably competent, if hot-blooded, young man Fulvius
represents in himself the successful mergi ng of ancient aristocratic nature
and generous commercial nurture (4528-32).

It is worth noting that while lie introduces or emphasizes class distinc-
tions between characters, in his accommodative comedy Vincent almost
eliminates the vulgarly mercenary motives prevalent in Luchetti’s play. In
Vincent's Ancona there are, except for the Jew Eleazer, of course, no
predatory cheats and, therefore, no gulls. Tiberius's daughters and Asel-
lio’s cloak, even the clown’s ducat, are restored. The near tragic errors of
the day—Fulvius's taking Flavia for a whore or Astraea’s jealousy—arise
from insufficient trust, as Nicolaus explains, from appearances rather than
“causes” (214-15).

Despite Vincent’s continuing the long tradition of borrowing from the
Italian for Cambridge drama, he also seems to be drawing from English
