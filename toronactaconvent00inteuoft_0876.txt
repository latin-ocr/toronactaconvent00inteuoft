848 SIXTEENTH-CENTURY PHILOSOPHERS FROM NEw SPAIN

Alonso de la Vera Cruz

Alonso was one of the forerunners of the philosophica} and, in general
terms, intellectual life of the New Spain. He established chairs, schools
and libraries, and was one of the first lecturers at the Real y Pontificia
Universidad de Mexico.

In 1540 he was the first to teach philosophy at the town of Tiripetio
and, after the foundation in 1553 of the Universidad de Mexico, he
obtained the chair of Saint Thomas' theology.² As a result of his pedagog-
ical experiences here, he wrote a philosophica} course; this work, where he
deals with minor and major logie as well as physics in the Aristotelian
sense, may rightfully be considered as “the first philosophical course‘’ of
the New World.³ The first noticeable humanistic trait in Alonso's work is
his polished style, within the limits afforded by the rough scholastic Latin.

A good example of these efforts may be found in the prefaces to his
three philosophica} treatises: his Recognitio summulamm (1554), his Dia-
lectica resolutio (1554), and his Physica speculatio (1557).⁴ The complaints
against the ergotistic excesses of the decadent scholastics evince even
more characten'stics of humanism proper. I believe that the criticisms
addressed against these writers in Alonso’s first work, the Recognitio
summulamm, are of the utmost importance on account of their similarity
