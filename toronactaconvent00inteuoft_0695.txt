philosophica} and historical works, whereas he wants to embrace the
whole literary output of antiquity, “ut sciamus, quid homines sapientissimi
de humanis animis senserint” (Sl-32). His adversaries want to confine
each teacher to his own discipline, “clamantque regendos esse professio-
num fines, suisque quamque limitibus ac terminis coercendam” (33). But
philosophy without eloquence is arid, barbaric and sordid, and eloquence
without philosophy is vain and empty. “Oratio’' and “ratio,” “copia
rerum” and “copia verborum” should be inseparable. Here philosophy is
assimilated to literature: “A philosophis omnis doctrina liberalis, a philoso-
phis omnis historia, a philosophis omnis artium varietas sumi potest” (36).
Philosophy like literature is necessary to the rulers of the state, to lawyers
and administrators and all who use eloquence, and the role of the teacher
(whether of literature or philosophy, or both together), is therefore
paramount.⁶

There is one important later speech on the purpose of literature to
which Ι shall return, but wish first to say something of Muret’s life-long
interest in theology and moral and political philosophy since this illumi·
nates the highly moral view he had of literature. In De dignitate ac praestan-
tia studii Theologici (Paris, 1552) he treats theology as the most important
of the liberal arts, Homer’s golden chain, or Jacob's ladder, linking the
divine and the human; it is the fire which Christ, the true Prometheus,
brought down from heaven. Three speeches delivered in Rome underline
his moral outlook: De Moralis philosophiae laudibus (1563), in which he says
that the teaching of political philosophy is particularly appropriate in
Rome, the source of empire, law and religion, De Moralis philosophiae
necessitate (1564) where he says that it brings freedom, repose and public
and private “salus,'’ and De sui cognitione, deque omnibus humani animi facul·
tatibus (1565). His views on the practical working out of ethical principles
may be seen in his De justitiae laudibus (1565) and his account of teaching
them in De toto studiorum suorum cursu, deque Eloquentia ac caeteris disciplinis
cum Jun'spmdentia conjungendis (1567). He takes up the subject in various
other speeches and commentaries on Plato and An'stotle.⁷
