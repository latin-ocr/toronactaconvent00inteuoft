764 ERASMUS ΑΝΙ) AURELIUS

was not the last to defend Cicero and more than once Erasmus mentions
in his Vita Hieronymi Italian and Dutch humanists who had understood the
importance of the bond between Cicero and Jerome: Valla, Politiano,
Barbaro, Pico and “noster Rodolphus Agricola.’'²⁶

1 come now to the conclusion of my paper on Erasmus, Aurelius and
their lives of Jerome. It is obvious that the inspiration of Erasmus by
Jerome and his works had already originated in the religious Dutch milieu
to which both Aurelius and Erasmus belonged. It was not due to John
Colet, whose lectures onjerome Erasmus heard at Oxford in 1500, that he
started to work on the study of scripture, the reform of theology and
especially on Jerome.²⁷ It would not only be an overestimation of the
inssuence of Colet on the development of Erasmus's theological scholar-
ship, but also at the same time it is an underestimation of the role of his
former friend and correspondent, Cornelis Gerard, better known as
Aurelius. It was Aurelius who recommended to Erasmus in 1489 the
letters of Jerome as the best example of classical rhetoric and Christian
piety, before Erasmus answered arrogantly: “As for your inciting me to
read through these letters, 1 am most grateful. But 1 have long ago read
them. . . .”²⁸

Whatever may be the truth of that contention, it has been convincingly
proved that Aurelius had an important influence on the early religious
poetry of Erasmus, and that he added a long citation from the mouth of
Jerome to the Apologia adversus barbaros of Erasmus, written already before
the letter mentioned earlier.²⁹ It was possibly under the influence of
Aurelius that Erasmus turned to theology and especially to the study of
Jerome, as has also been argued by Prof. IJsewijn.³⁰ For this we also find
proof in the years 1497s1498 when both are staying in Paris. At that time
Aurelius is studying manuscripts with works ofJerome in the library of the
