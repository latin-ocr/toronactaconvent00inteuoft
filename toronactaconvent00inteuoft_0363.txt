E. v. GEORGE 339

Tum illa ingenio mitissimo puella: “Et quam,’' inquit, “toto (ut
dicitur) erras coelo! An tu solus ignoras huius esse utramque ge-
nesim inenarrabilem, ineffabilem?” (p. 6)

And beginning with the angel Gabriel‘s words, Mary embarks on a
scripturally based explication of her divine son’s future. Coming to a por-
trayal of the Father, the Son and the Paraclete as three suns which have
converged into one, she challenges him: “tu nunc his signorum ortibus et
obitibus‚ his vagantium fixorumque siderum coniunctionibus variisque
aspectibus, quis en't puer hic, si vales, coniicito” (9-10). Vives demurs:

Quamvis mihi, o sacratissima Virgo, hominem ingenio monstrares
celerrimo et perspicacissime, etsi nonnihil sane divinam hausisset
sapientiam, eum ego haudquaquam puto vel mediocri modo enar-
rare posse quantus infantulus iste tuus futurus sit; tantum abest, ut
ego, vir nihili, neque litteras doctus (ut aiebant) neque natare, ea
ipsa contingere ac penetrare satis tuto mysteria queam. (p. 10)

Obviously, Vives’ offering has been a hopeless waste of time. He listens
quietly as Mary occupies four pages with further remarks onJesus’ impact
on human history. She charges him (p. 14) to act as “gentili populo
salutiger,” and to carry news of this wonderful birth. When Vives tries to
evade any such responsibility, Mary replies with a classic humanistic litany
of erudition: why should gentiles find Jesus’ resurrection unbelievable,
since they accept the resurrection os Arcas the son of Callisto, the benefi-
ciaries of Aesculapius, Er of Pamphylia, and others? She is as conversant
with secular learning as with sacred. Having neutralized the value of Vives'
astronomical lore, she now preempts his territory in yet another respect.
Vives’ uselessness is confirmed.

On his excursion to the Aedes Legum, Vives meets a cantankerous
doorkeeper at the entrance to the edifice, and politely inquires, “Parens
optime, quis hic habet?” The man replies: “Filie, si aves, audibis. Nam ex
nostris mihi videris congerronibus nosque amare.” Vives is gratified:
“Quae tua est humanitas! Congerro vero tuusne sum, parum scio; gerro
certe, et magnus quidem, sum.’' Vives aims first of all to be agreeable: the
impression he makes will be chosen to suit his need to get along with his
interlocutos so as to find out as much as he can.

The old gatekeeper laments the burial of true legal knowledge under the
obscuring avalanche of comments by Accorso, Bardo, and others, and longs
for a renewal of legal studies by cultivators of ancient wisdom such as Vives:

Vtinam a tehe tisque aliis similibus sociennis, qui veteres ollas et
veras sophias calendan‘ et exterebrare commalaxatis, prosferarem uti
