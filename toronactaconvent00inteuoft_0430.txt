406 THE PROLOGUES or COMOEmA SACRA

We should bear this difference in mind when we contrast Gnapheus’
use of the prologue with the practices of his successors. A good deal of
Gnapheus’ motives for the particular form of the prologue to Acolastus will
have been the desire to make his play as Terentian as possible. He tackles
the more technical literary points in his preface and postpones the Chris-
tian moral and explanation to the interestingly un-Terentian feature of the
epilogue or ρετονατίο.4 In the prologue he deals almost entirely with possi·
ble attacks on his noua impudentia in challenging comparison with Roman
comedy, and launches a counter-attack on those content with bad produc-
tions (or possibly bad imitations) of Plautus and Terence. This is very
much in the spirit of Terence’s prologues: the only real difference, and it
is an important one, is that while Terence defends himself against (pre-
sumably) real past attacks from one rival poet in particular, Gnapheus‚
since this is his first play, can only imagine and anticipate hostile reactions
to this drama.⁵ Without any external need he evokes an atmosphere of
controversy and presents himself as the bold spirit who dares to follow the
ancients (though at the same time modestly acknowledging their superiori-
ty), and who is unjustly attacked by an inferior crowd of calumniators-
whose attacks, however, only serve to highlight his own genius. Gnapheus
thus conforms to the preferred persona of countless fifteenth— and early
sixteenth-century Latin writers, setting himself in a self-styled ‘progressive'
milieuf‘

so that here publication seems to be secondary to performance and forms a record of it;
but the inclusion of this list is also a bow to the play as text, in that it provides a neat
modern version of the didascalia or record of performance transmitted in the manu-
scripts of many classica] plays. Not only by the mere act of publication does the play
become text; the author himself may deliberately exploit the ambiguity between oral and
written. On this topic in general, see also Jean Lebeau, Salvator Mundi: L“oecemple” de
Joseph dans le the‘atre allemand au XVIe siecle (Nieuwkoop, 1977) 109-14.

⁴ Epilogues are the norm in comoedia sacra, and presumably derive largely from
vernacular models; the only classica] exemplars are from tragedy. The vernacular
connexion is demonstrated by their appearance in both the German and the Latin
plays of Sixt Birck, while Macropedius introduces the further popular feature of the
Fool into several of his epilogues. Evidently, having decided on a hyper-Terentian
prologue, Gnapheus was forced to use an epilogue in order to point the moral. This
is not so inappropriate3 the fact that the play has a clear message is, after all, the least
Terentian thing about it.

⁵ A later comic prologue, that of Macropedius' Bassarus (1540), can use the
Terentian device in its exact form, referring to criticism of the previous year’s play.
ὅ Possibly Gnapheus even wished to distract attention from a more real controver-

sy, hinted at in lines 5-6 of the prologue: “verum enimuero hic nouis] de dogmatis ne
μῦ quidem.” Such Lutheran content as the play does possess is discreetly handled.
