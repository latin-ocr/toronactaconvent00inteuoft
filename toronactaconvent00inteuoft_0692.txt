666 MARc-ANTomE MURET

neuve d'Agen, and Bordeaux where Montaigne was among his pupils)
before moving to Paris. He next went into more or less voluntary exile in
Italy after being accused of homosexual practices and there spent the
second half of his life, working in Venice, Padua and Rome where he was
ordained priest in 1576. The main thrust of his teaching was literary,
though this must be understood broadly since he insisted on alternating
rhetorical texts with philosophical ones, and his teaching of law was a
lengthy interlude before a final phase of teaching history and ethics in
tandem.

At the time Muret wrote there was much confusion about the meaning
and scope of the term “literae humaniores'' and related expressions: they
were sometimes understood more or less synonymously with “bonae
artes'’ or “artes liberales,’' that is with Greek and Latin literature, includ-
ing all that was written on any of the liberal arts. But the notion of the
seven liberal arts was a theoretical one and the list had been modified and
enlarged over many centuries, until it embraced not only subjects like
poetry and history, but also laW, medicine and theology; and the encyclo-
pedia of the arts was seen as equivalent to philosophy according to the
all-embracing Ciceronian definition‚ and ultimately literature, the liberal
arts‚ the study of humanities‚ and culture became indistinguishable. The
confusion arises because the terms were not always used synonymously,
for example, when attempts were made to distinguish literature from
either philosophy or history, or when teachers of one discipline resented
teachers of other subjects intruding in their domains. In the case of
Muret, the matter is further complicated by his strong belief in the cross-
fertilization of disciplineS, and by his desire to define afresh the role of
the teacher of literature who will no longer be the old “grammaticus’'
teaching little boys, but someone who will initiate maturer students into
the study of a new independent discipline. Muret owed much both to the
experience of the para-university College Royal, and to the stimulating
humanist atmosphere of the Pan‘s colleges in which Dorat‚ Turniebe,
Buchanan, Lambin, and Ramus were revolutionizing the teaching of
literature, and to the literary milieux of Ronsard and his Pleiade of poets.³
