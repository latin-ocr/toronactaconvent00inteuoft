850 SIXTEENTH-CENTURY PHILOSOPHERS FROM NEW SPAIN

This author, nevertheless, does not limit himself to these tirades, but
also proposes specific innovations: he demonstrates the need to get rid of
many of the treatises in question and to substitute for thern the authentic
teachings of Aristotle, Cicero and Themistius. Besides advocating the
return to the classical tradition, Alonso adopts as well some principles
from the humanists themselves for his renewal projects‚ such as Ro-
dolphus Agricola's treatment of the dialectical topics in his De Inventione
Dialectica3 in Alonso’s view, Agricola provides the best model to follow.⁸

The high opinion that Agricola merited for his method of dealing with
dialectics, among other achievements‚ is clearly stated by Alonso in his
Recognitio summulamm, where he is praised thus:

Et post Aristotelem et Ciceronem, vnicus nostris temporibus, Ro-
dolphus Agricola de inuenfione, et de locis dialecticis edidit libros
eruditissimos, simul et eloquentissimos. Quos consulo legendos ab
illis, qui serio in animo habent hanc dialectices partem, quam Topica
vocant, adamussim penetrare.⁹

Alonso's admiration for Agricola was such that he admitted that this
author had set an example he would desire to follow since he believed
that Agricola could be compared in equal terms with the classical writers:

Constet Rodolphum doctissimum et antiquis comparandum .S.S. R.
Agricola qui pro meritis vix laudari queat, qui in sua De Inventione
Dialectica procul a tergo sunt sophismata reliquenda docet.¹⁰

An examination of Alonso’s treatise on dialectic shows that he adopts-
right from the first lines—the definition of topic furnished by Agricola,
thus setting the pattern for the ulterior development of the subject,
thereby confirming the esteem in which he held this author:

Locus est communis quaedam rei nota, cuius admonitu, quid in
quaque reprobabile sit, potest inueniri. Sic Rodolphus. Haec de-
finitio clare ostendit in quem finem loci dialectici sint inuenti, velut
quaedam monimenta memoriae, ubi invenitur quod ad rern pro-
bandam conducat.¹¹
