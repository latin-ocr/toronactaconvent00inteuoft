172 THE JEPHTHAH TRAGEDIES

drifted far apart; they embody totally different attitudes in life. His Jeph-
thah is a haughty, high-handed zealot, who “suffered from an Abraham
complex,’' as Parente has put it aptly.¹l But this may well be a modern
reaction to the character. Vondel may have meant him to be a man of
unflinching fidelity to his beliefs, who might even deserve some admira—
tion, though he goes to ruin through his blind one-sidedness. Neverthe-
less, he is a man of quickly changing emotions: determination alternates
with despair, self-pity, sels-accusation, sheer arrogance, stupidity, remorse.
Ultimately he becomes reconciled with God. Buchanan's hero was still in
some way protected by the traditional dogmas and opinions of his society.
Vondel's Jephthah acts solely from his own conscience.¹² The sacerdos in
the fifth episode of Buchanan's play is a humanist of Erasmian stamp, who
makes a lonely stand against the superstitious of his age. The two priests
in the third act of Vondel's drama represent the common sense of ecclesi-
astical authority. Their main argument is: “Thou shalt not kill.’' The moth-
er—her name in Vondel’s play is Filopaie, a pseudo-Greek word that he
coined himself¹³—embodies the strong maternal love of an independent,
rich Amsterdam matron rather than being a rhetorical abstmctjon of love
and sorrOW. Iphis hardly participates in the action. From her first radiant
appearance in the lyric concluding the first act she is and remains angelically
pure, innocent and obedient, rejoicing in the coming sacrifice. There is 3
marked sexist atmosphere around her and no question of any change in her
attitude as there was in the models of Buchanan and EuripideS.

Vondel’s Jeptha was a succesful play.¹⁴¹ It centers around a real dilem-
ma, it shows characters rich in contrast and of diverse emotions; the plot
is ingeniously built, the whole story thrilling, the poetry splendid. Of all
the Jephthah plays in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it is by far
the most lively piece of literature. But 1 think that too much has been
made of its religious or moral depth. Of course, there is no denying the
moral lesson as voiced by the “Hofpriester'’ in the play (W. 1956-1978):
the conflict between individual conscience and church authority was
certainly of real significance to Vondel and his audience or readers. But to
the extent that the theme (the vow and the sacrifice) is losing its obvious-

¹³ No doubt because of Heinsius's criticism of the name Storgc (op. cit., 205).
Heinsius did not see through Buchanan’s significant names.

mances in the years 1659-63; see E. Oey-De Vita and M. Gcesink, Academie en
