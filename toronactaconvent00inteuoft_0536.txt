512 PRINTED COMMONPLACE Booxs

destined to a much shorter printed career, was the Lumen animae (Augs-
burg, 1477). Its third part is an alphabetical commonplace book of topics
suitable for sermons, in the manner of the Manipulusflmum (and indeed
largely derived from it), but the first and longest part is an encyclopedia
in which a diversity of natural phenomena are described and moralised in
great detail. The commonplace-book formula for building up matter
cumulatively and selectively from a proliferation of disparate texts here
functions as a complement or an adjunct to a very different process,
whereby discourse is generated through interpretation, that is, by transla-
tion from one code of meaning to another.⁵ Our next example, the
Summa predicantium of John of Bromyard, who died in 1352, was printed
at Nuremberg in 1484. Bromyard integrates the commonplace-book
formula much more fully into yet another way of unfolding concepts in
words. The Summa is an extremely well indexed, workable retrieval system,
arranged alphabetically by topics which are further subdivided by divisions
and distinctions to produce the branch-patterns characteristic of the
development of a medieval sermon. Quotations, mainly Biblical‚ but also
examples derived from ancient sources, are drawn in to illustrate and
confirm each proposition. In this case the commonplace book organises
not only extrapolated quotations, but a strategy for deploying them by
distinctions, producing ramifications which are radically different from the
linear composition favoured by humanist dialecticians. And yet, Bromyard
is reprinted later in the neo-Latin period.

Not all printed commonplace books available around 1500 were refer-
ence tools for professional religious, though these tend to be the most
systematically organised. There was also a less strong secular tradition of
which the most notable medieval survival was probably the early four-
teenth-century Compendium moralium notabilium of Hieremias of Montag-
none, of which there is a single printed edition in 1505. Montagnone’s
aim was to produce a digest of moral wisdom, with extracts from a very
comprehensive array of Christian and pagan authors, from Plato down to
Montagnone's own time. The way the headings, or tituli, are arranged
distinguishes this primarily secular work from its clerical counterparts with
their easily searched alphabetical order. Montagnone proposes a topogra-
phy of moral science, beginning with religion and the good, and then
dividing all possible aspects of the active life under titles which are subdivi-
sions of the four cardinal virtues. Despite the alphabetical index append-
