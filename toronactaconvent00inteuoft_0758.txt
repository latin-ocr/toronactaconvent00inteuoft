notably that of Erasmus.⁸ He did not profess atheism in any extant docu-
ment,⁹ but we have reliable witnesses to his utterance of such views orally.
One is Joannes Angelus Odonus, who visited Dolet in Lyons when Dolet
was working at Sebastian Gryphius’s pn'nting house: Odonus declared‚ in
a letter to Gilbertus Cognatus dated October 29, 1535, that the University
or Parlement of Paris might be preparing to have him executed for his
atheism-which was public knowledge, for Dolet's own words declared him
to be an “impious fellow, without God, without saith, without religion.'’
Dolet, he wrote, perceptively and prophetically, is “For the sake of a slight
breath of applause, [. . .] rushing to certain destruction both of body and
soul.''¹⁰ Another commentator on Dolet's religious views is Bonaventure
Des Periers who worked with Dolet from the summer of 1535 until May
1536 correcting the first volume of Dolet's massive Commentarii Linguoe
Latinoe ¹¹ and who, in his Cymbalum mundi of 1537, implicitly accuses

⁸ Dolet felt particular scorn for theologians: his De imitatione Ciceroniana of 1535
rails against “the insolence, the intolerable conceit and the lunacy not just of Erasmus
but of the whole sect of Lutherans.” Ranking Erasmus among the Lutherans was a
solecism, and an intentionally offensive one, insinuating that Erasmus's refutations
were counterproductive-—and that dogmatic theologians are all indistinguishable, and
all equally noxious. Religion, Dolet urges, “consists entirely in an inner stirring of the
soul, in religious awe, in reverence—and is not brought about by words: if you debate
about it, or write freely and verbosely about it, then reverence will wither, religious
awe will gradually be removed, belief in God will be destroyed and religion will
decline into mere commonplace and be dissipated.’' The De imitatione Ciceroniana,
though ostensibly philological, is a work of theology, or anti-theology—and highly
readable. See the edition by E. V. Telle: L'Erasmianus sive Ciceronianus d'Etienne Dolet
(1535) (Geneve‚ 1974), especially p. 34—37 of the facsimile, where the passages 1 have
translated here are found. Dolet’s cavalier dismissal of Erasmus amounts, needless to
say, to caricature: Erasmus, too, saw the need for silence in the face of the divine (see
J. C. Margolin, “Erasme et le silence,” Melanges Saulnier (Geneve, 1984), 163-78).
Dolet’s abrasive attack on theology recalls another adversary of Erasmus the renegade
Carthusian Otto Brunfels, the founder of modern Nicodemism: the links between the
two are explored in my forthcoming study of contemporary views on Dolet.

⁹ Scholars have frequently pointed this out, from Maittaire onwards: “At invisum
ἀθεον nomen, quod Doleto inurit Scaliger, illi convenire nondum mihi fuit satis
compertum. Quantum ex aliquibus eiusdem operibus conjici0, non tantum Deum esse
aperte professus est, sed a religione Christiana minime alienum et generalioribus
ejusdem dogmatibus imbutum esse se indicavit'’ (ΙΙΙ, i, 17; cf. 101 and notes there).
But it is meaningless to say that there is no atheism in Dolet's writing. To consign
such thought to print was to write one’s own death sentence.

Dolet, see Lougeon, Bibliographie, xxv-xxviii.
