Although the Yale commentary on John Milton's OsEducation might

seem definitive regarding the “curriculum'’ of studies that he
envisions,¹ a number of problems touching the rationale underlying
Milton's epistolary essay and the broader significance of his educational
program still ask resolution. They are too complex to treat fully in the
space available here. However, if we compare the scheme of studies that
Milton proposes in Q‘Edumtion with the Hellenistic taxonomy of the arts
and sciences set forth by the Dutch polymath Gerardus Joannes Vossius
(1577-1649) in his De artium et scientiarum natura, some provocative
features of Reformed thinking about education and intellectual activity in

the seventeenth century emerge, Ι think, with unusual clarity.² As rector
