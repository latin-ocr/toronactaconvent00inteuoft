108 NEC-LATIN RESOURCES FOR BIOGRAPHY

his literary style, as well as on his theology.²² There were other editions
of the Church Fathers which Erasmus completed at Basel, but in none of
them did he write a biography, perhaps, as Bietenholz suggests, because
he felt himself growing old (as he began to do in the early 1520s) and
because his time was now too precious for the kind of research that he
had lavished on Jerome.²³

Two other Erasmian biographies need to be mentioned: the one letter
in which he portrayed Thomas More, and the other which gave a double
portrait of John Colet and jean Vitrier. More's portrait is in the letter to
Ulrich von Hutten ofJuly 1519.²⁴ It is familiar to all of you, and Germain
Marc'hadour has commented on it in loving detail. There, clearly, one
finds skillful employment of all of the resources of rhetoric of which 1
have been speaking. The double portrait of Colet and Vitrier is contained
in a letter to Jodocus Jonas, dated June 1521, and it invites comparison
with the double portrait of Erasmus and Peter Gilles by Quentin Metsys.
It too is well-known enough to all of you. These are available to us today;
they were also familiar to contemporaries and followers of More and
Erasmus. In Erasmus' letter-portraits are to be found something very like
Dutch genre-paintings of family life in simple and charming detail. One
feels (Bietenholz comments) that with More's family

Erasmus here beheld a practical application of philosophia Christi with
which his own nature was incompatible—that he admired in More
not so much his own disciple as rather a congenial spirit endowed
with many qualities that Erasmus himself lacked. It is on this basis
that he envisaged a Plutarch-like comparison between the lives of
More and Bude, but regrettably did not go beyond a mere hint.²⁵

Let me extend this use of Bietenholz by drawing upon his comment that

there is some evidence of a favourable response from among his
contemporaries. Moringus, who himself wrote several biographies,
including one of Augustine, expressed his admiration for Hieronymi
vita. [Allen Vll, 393] Allen notes an English translation, in 1533 [by
Tyndale], of the letter addressed to Jonas containing the portraits of
Vitrier and Colet. [1V, 507 n.] . .. in the subsequent life of More by
