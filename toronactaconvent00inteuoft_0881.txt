Aristotle's organon (Categmies and Posterior Analytioe), and an Opmaclum of
select arguments about logie proceed from his teachings on Arts. His
lectures, discussions and moral counselling may have furnished the
material for his theologico-economic work about commercial treatises and
contracts, Sum de tratas y contratos.¹⁶ After publishing his works and
teaching at the Dominican convent in Seville, 'romais set out on the jour-
ney back to his province of Santiago de Mexico, but was taken ill on board
the ship and finally succumbed to his discase. Tomas de Mercado’s burial
took place at sea, near the coast of San Juan de Uhia, Veracruz, in 1575.

In my view, the most interesting facet of Tomas’ productiori, and the
one that shows the clearest signs of humanistic influence, or at least, of an
attempt at approaching humanistic ideals, is his translation of Aristotle's
Categon‘es and Posterior Analyfioe, to which Porfirio's Eisagvgv could be
added. Like Alonso de la Vera Cruz, Tomas does not satisfy himself with
merely reforming the teaching of logie by eliminating abstruse or useless
treatises, nor with just proposing that Aristotle’s precepts should find
again their proper place in the philosophical text-books, following the
humanistic ideal of the return to the classics. Instead, Tomas favours
actively this reform and return by rendering An'stotle’s major logie in an
elegant and polished translation. This text had already been translated by
other scholastics, such as William of Moerbecke, but their versions were so
inelegant that their very uncouthness prompted Tomas to produce his
own. He himself states that one of the reasons why these types of works
have become defaced is:

quod latini Antores e graeco (quo idiomate Aristotiles eam tradidit)
sermone rudi, et (vt ita dicam) inciuili transtulerunt.¹⁷

Tomas also stresses that the difficulties inherent in Aristotle’s text have
been further compounded by some translators or interpreters who intro-
