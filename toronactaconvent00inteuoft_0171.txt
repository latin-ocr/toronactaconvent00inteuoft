sion, its use often public. In any case, medieval theon‘sts did not distin-
guish the formal, public letter from the familiar, pn'vate letter. Even the
familiar letter followed the rules of art. The Quattrocento humanists paid
lip service to the classical definition of the letter as a conversation between
absent friends on their persona} affairs, and they tried to purify epistolary
style of medieval barbarism, but they continued to teach letter-writing as
an art of persuasion. Nothing about the Libellus is remarkable except its
thoroughness. Only an imagination of Erasmian fecundity could have
described methods of inventing and amplifying epistolary arguments in
such copious detail.

The Formula may provide clues to the next stage in revision. Here
Erasmus praises the letters of Angelo Poliziano. Poliziano’s correspon-
dence was first published posthumously in his Omnia opem (Venicez in
aedibus Aldi Romani, July 1498), but Erasmus seems not to have seen it for
some two years. He does not mention it in the Libellus, as he certainly
would have done had he known it. In the For-mula, as Jolidon has ob-
served, Erasmus admires the incredibilis nitor of Poliziano‘s letters, echoing
the phrase he used to describe Poliziano's style in the dedication to
Mountjoy of the Adagiorum collectanea (Parisz J. Philippi, 1500). In the
Opus, Poliziano is Erasmus' favorite contemporary letter-writer. He warmly
recommends him as a model, and he expands the examples of invective he
had cited in the Libellus by adding Poliziano’s debate with the Ciceronian
Bartolomeo Scala (ASD 1-2z536-37).

‘The relationship of the tiny, disjointed For-mula to Erasmus’ work-in-
progress on letter-writing is enigmatic. It cannot be an epitome of the
Libellus, Although it touches the same topics (style and the threefold
classification of letters as demonstrative, deliberative, and judicial)‚ it
ignores important material (formulas for greeting and farewell‚ epithets,
the “mixed’‘ letter, “extraordinary'’ letters, and the detailed description
and illustration of the argument and organization of each type of “un-
mixed’' letter). Moreover, asJolidon observes, much of the work is not
original but mere paraphrase. 1 have argued that the Formula is Erasmus’
notes for revision rather than a new draft. Reading Poliziano's correspon-
dence had alerted Erasmus to current issues in Italian humanism. Poliziano’s
dedicatory letter to Piero de’ Medici and his exchanges with Bartolomeo
Scala and Paolo Conesi advocate eclectic reading and imitation of classica]
models in opposition to a narrow, exclusive Ciceronianism.

Although the For-mula opens by quoting “Ubanius,” Erasmus has begun
to question the classical distinction between the letter and the oration.
There are some, he argues, “who maintain that there should be no use of
artificia} rules in personal, everyday letters, but that they should be made
