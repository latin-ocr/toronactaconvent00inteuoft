806 VIVES’S THEORY OF DELIBERATIVE ORATORY

proceed to an action. It is in this area that, as Vives explains, the physical
condition and the character, and also the financial and social condition
must be taken into account.¹⁵

A second factor explaining the focus on the loci a persona right at the
beginning of the treatise becomes manifest in the section de exercenda
facultate. In this section Vives, following basically the classical theory of
ethos, states that the counsellor, in order to reach his goal of persuasion,
must do all he can to ensure the impression that he is a friendly and a
good and wise man.¹⁶ Although Vives does not explicitly refer here to
the credentials mentioned at the beginning of the treatise, his discussion
of the subject makes clear that he is dealing exclusively with the loci a
persona. For in the process of establishing his authority, it is very impor-
tant that the counsellor knows which attitude to take towards his hearer,
who can be his equal‚ but who can also be his superior or inferior. This
last point seems to be a somewhat new aspect in deliberative oratory, at
least, that is how Vives presents it to the reader. In the old days of free
republics, he explains, it was allowed to attack any person who did not
agree. Even then it was a rule that one should not speak evil of those who
had a good reputation. This is true even more so for us Christians, he
says, but he adds that the counsellor must also bear in mind that one must
use a different tone towards equals—say, members of a City Council-than
towards a superior—say, the emperor.¹⁷ In short, we read, the sixteenth-
century counsellor must always adapt his behavior to the standards of
modesty and gravity.¹⁸ It is obvious that the consideration of all the
credentials‚ as mentioned at the beginning of the treatise, of the persons
involved in the deliberative process is essentia! in doing so.

Let us now briefly take a look at a second area where Vives seems to
modify ancient theory. We have seen that he defines the vast field of
human activities (the opera manuum and the actiones animi) as the subject
matter for deliberative oratory and that in each deliberative process,

opinio prudentiae . . .” (ed. Mayansius, 245); “Ergo tota oratione danda opera est, ne
quid dicas quod opinionem vel probitatis, vel amicitiae, vel prudentiae imminuat,
augeat potius quantum licebit . . .” (ed. Mayansius, 247). Compare the general remarks
on ethos in Aristotle, Rhet. l.2.4; 1.8.6; 3.7.6-7‚ and the treatment of ethos in Quin-
tilian, Inst. 6.2.13-19.
