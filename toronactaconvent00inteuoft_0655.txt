Bartholomaeus Coloniensis: Two Fables

PIETER SCHOONBEEG

ontrary to any suggestion its geography might make, the northern
and eastern parts of what is now the Netherlands were the first to
be touched by Italian humanism. In the proud and prosperous cities of
the Hanseatic League around the middle of the fifteenth century, an
awareness of intellectual and cultural studies grew that was already rapidly
reaching its zenith in Italy. The first enthusiasm for these new studia
humanitatis was centered in the Cistercian monastery of Aduard just to the
northwest of the city of Groningen; hence the term Adwert Academy. Its
“members” were teachers and clerics and they had a tremendous influence
on tumre generations, Bartholomaeus Coloniensis was a product of this
intellectual atmosphere.¹ He was highly thought of by his contemporaries,
In his twenty-third letter Erasmus remarks: “Pretaerea Bartholomaeum
Coloniensem a literatorum numero secludendum censuerim minime.'‘²
Born in about 1460, probably in Cologne, Bartholomaeus was educated
at Alexander Hegius's school in Deventer‚ where he stayed on as a teacher
after his studies. From Deventer he moved to Zwolle where, still teaching, he
remained until 1506. That same year he succeeded Johannes Grovius as
rector of St. Maun'tius’s school at Msmster. In 1511 he moved to Alkmaar to
replace Bastius as rector of the Latin School. One of his colleagues here was
Alardus of Amsterdam who later was to edit Agricola’s works. In 1513 he
returned to Deventer‚ and three years later he died at Minden.
