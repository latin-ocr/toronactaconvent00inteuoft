200 MULCASTER AND MERCURIALE

programs he promises to outline in subsequent volumes), reform of the
training of teachers‚ instruction for girls, and so on. All of this is pre-
sented as deliberative advice to the Queen and her ministers, and through-
out Mulcaster emphasizes the political significance of his reforms, which
are all directed to uniformity in religion and politics. A good third of the
book is, however, given over to the other topic announced in the title—
“health in their bodie.” This is the matter that 1 shall here examine—what
Mulcaster wrote about sports and how he depended on the Latin treatise
of a near contemporary Italian physician named Girolamo Mercuriale for
the great bulk of what he had to say.

Positions is divided into three parts—first, a short series of preliminary
chapters that summan’ze what is to come and that propose and defend a
rhetorical division of the matter; next, a long series of chapters on physical
education, and finally chapters on the general shape of institutional
reform for English education. In his discussion of education, Mulcaster is
determined to recuperate from the writings of Plato, Aristotle, and
Xenophon the program of the Greeks and to situate this program within
a specifically English framework. Although he refers often to Quintilian,
he is actually shifting the basis of education away from the Roman model
of the professionally skilled rhetor or lawyer implicit in much of humanist
theory to a broader Greek model of the complete citizen. Thus, he spends
the largest section of Positions discussing a subject that neither Cicero nor
Quintilian mentions in relation to rhetoric—sports.

His section on sports begins with a general defence of physical educa-
tion, then goes on to what he calls indoor and outdoor sports‚ and ends
with his suggestions for the “training master’' or coach. In some ways the
first part of his program—indoor sports—must have seemed odd or even
absurd to his contemporaries. Such exercises as loud speaking, holding
your breath, and even laughing he presents as seriously as he does danc-
ing or fencing. Yet these unusual exercises were well known to Antiquity
and are entirely defensible within the categories of Galenic medicine. His
program for outdoor sports would however have seemed more familiar to
his English contemporaries. Swimming, running, riding, shooting the
longbOW‚ and hunting were the traditional sports of a feudal warrior class
that had by the early part of the sixteenth century been transformed into
the gentry.² Mulcaster wishes to see all the traditional sports as part of a
