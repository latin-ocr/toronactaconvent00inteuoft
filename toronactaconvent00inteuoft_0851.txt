Α hallmark of Lucian's dialogues which sets them apart from the
philosophica} Ciceronian dialogue or the didacn’c dialogue of the Middle
Ages is the avoidance of “closure” whether ideological or discursive.
Definition is normally avoided in Lucian's works by undercutting the
authority of the narrator, by interrupting the direction of a line of thought
with a dramatic event, or by the use of irony and paradox to suggest that
the meaning of the text is contrary to the letter.⁸

The quattrocento humanists (Poggio Bracciolini, Leon Battista Alberti,
Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, Giovanni Pontano)‚ while they imitate many
of the conventions of the Lucianic dialogue, also modify the Syrian’s
impartial and “open” discourse and place it at the service of a specific
agenda. Peace and the need for institutional reform were not, for the
majority of humanists, a value-free exploration. The translation of Lucian’s
Attic Greek into versions marked by a Latin ideal of gravitas reinforced
this closure.⁹ Τὴε early Latin renditions of Lucian as well as later imita-
tions are characterized more by demonstration than by the fanciful play of
personalities in the satires of Lucian.

The satin'c dialogue in the Quattrocento‚ then, was, from the point of
view of discourse, a double tradition: in the Greek original, the discourse
was “open,” In the Latin translations and imitations, the discourse tended
to defend a specific agenda and was, as a result, “closed” For most of the
authors of Renaissance dialogi mortuomm, it was the Latin Lucian which
furnished a model for their discourse.

Vives's De dissidiis reflects the contradictions of this double tradition of
dialogue discourse. Like the quattrocento reformers, he chose a theme of
great political concern—the work was written only three years before the
siege of Vienna— a theme treated in the anti-Turkish literature of the
period with maximum closure. Yet Vives’s treatment is conspicuously
“open,” and is typical neither of the Lucianic imitations of the quattro-
cento nor of contemporary chancellery propaganda.

The language of De dissidiis is marked by neutralization and inversion

⁸ See Philopseudoe (29). In the Musca, the avoidance of closure is effected by the
mock-encomium, and in the Vitamm Auctio, the number of contradictory ideologies
expounded assures that no single point of view, other than the reductive skepticism of
the buyer, will mark the work.
