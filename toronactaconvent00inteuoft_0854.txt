is won and then lost (461)—make the strategems of the generals appear
ludicrous, and invalidate partisan ambition.

The rhetoric of the De dissidiis also reinforces the open discourse of the
piece. Questions are answered by questions (452-53). The repetition of
the key question of Minos-“Posses ne nobis, Tiresia, dicere, quaemad-
modum se se res hominum apud superos habeant?'’ (452)—serves to
collect and qualify a sen‘es of answers. Alternative hypotheses are com-
ῐῐιοῐι,11 declarations are inverted (“sed quid juvat quando non pecuniam
regunt reges, sed ipsos pecunia?'' [454])‚ and overly emphatic statements
reinterpreted to achieve diminutio. When Polypragmon boasts “Aperuit
Alpes Carolus'’ (457), Tiresias responds: “Hoc est, patefecit aditum
spoliationibus, cladibus, miseriae Galliae'' (457).

The most striking features of the openness of this dialogue are the con-
tradictory solutions to the Turkish problem presented toward the end of
the work, the normal place for closure, by two speakers of great authority,
Tiresias and Scipio. The solution of Tiresias the seer, like his refutation of
Basilius's praise of military glory, is typical of humanistic irenicism in
general as well as of Vives’s own De concordia et discordia and the late De
pacificatione,¹² and furnishes what appears to be a closing resume of the
conversation and of its corresponding rhetoric up to that point. The
dialogue appears to close on affirming a single point of view: the noble
Minos and Tiresias present what the reader takes to be the view of the
author, and the opposing viewpoint is presented by discredited speakers,

When Vives introduces Scipio, however, the tapestry unravels. Scipio,
an exemplar for the renaissance of the civil and military virtues of the
Roman Republic‚¹³ advocates an invasion of Asia for glory and booty‚ a
project which squarely negates the pacificism of Minos and Tiresias. The
general's reference to heroes—“Ergo nullus estjam locus, nec honos viris
fortibus?’' (467) he exclaims when he learns of the invention of the
cannon—for example, runs directly counter to Tiresias's description of
them as “latrones'' (472). Scipio's praise of the “praeclarum decus” and
“ingens nomen'' (479) as incentives to spur the Christian princes to invade

pecudem . . .'' (469); “ut est genus hominum insolens, vel odio quietis atque otii cujus
sunt impacientes . . .” (458-59).
