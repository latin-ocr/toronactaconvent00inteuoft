two possible patterns. In open style that records an interchange between
teacher and student, the student, or discipulus, asks a question to which
the teacher or magister, responds fully and accurately. Examples of this
sort include Plato's Laws and Cicero’s Brutus. Demonstrative argument can
be adapted to this structure; and, although the presentation of ideas often
takes precedence over characterization, the use of collateral circumstances,
similarities‚ oppositionS, and contradictions enable the writer to fulfill the
expectations of decorum and verisimilitude. Unlike the openness of the
magister—discipulus form, the closed style emphasizes disputation and a
concision of diction that may seem to obscure the truth sought by the
interlocutors. Both forms, though, have defects. Dialogue is not a treatise;
and, if a writer indulges in long explanations on mathematics, he must
add touches of brilliance through a description of characters and customs.
And if dialogue intends to refine intellectual insights, argumentation must
be dulled through techniques of pleasantness as prescribed by Hermo-
genes. Comedy results from ridiculous and amorous characters, and
tragedy depicts the fall of admirable personages. Analogously, dialogue
describes a harmony of contentions that results in keener souls.

IV. Conclusion

Like all Renaissance genres, dialogue eludes precise and rigid definition.
But as we have seen, Sigonius offers a description based upon an analysis
of ancient comments and a reading of classical models. In theory, any
definition implies exclusionism; but, in practice, especially with dialogue,
description requires inclusionism. Sigonius was certainly aware of the
numerous arts of disputation that sixteenth-century humanists had inherit-
ed from their medieval forebears. Rudolph Agricola, in his De inventiam
dialectica (1534), associates dialectics with dialogue;Johannes Sturm, in his
Partitionum dialecticarum libri (1539), devotes one of four books of this
dialectical treatise to dialogue; and Melanchthon, in his De elementis
rhetoricis (1542), views Cicero‘s art of disputation as a use of dialectics
embellished by the techniques of rhetoric.ll By 1550, then, dialogue
could be viewed as a mixture of forms. If we may use Zeno’s metaphor, it
combines aspects both of the “literature of the fist,'’ or the philosophical
argument, and of the “literature of the palm,'’ or rhetorical composi·
