824 vlvsss's DE EUROPAE Dlssmns ET BELLo TURC1co

turcico, which still awaits a critical edition, a good translation and a literary
reading.³ Marcel Bataillon‚ for example, only explores this work for the
author's ideological positions (Vives as Erasmist, his views on European
politics, and Spanish political hegemony),⁴ and treats Vives‘s dialogue
much in the same way he treats Alfonso de Valdes's apology of imperial
policy, disregarding the clearly different modes of development and
argumentation presented in the two apologies.

The literary value of Vives's dialogue on the division of Europe and the
Turkish threat can only be recuperated by situating it in the tradition of
the dialogus mortuorum. The work was written in 1526, a time when Lucian
was very much in the Valencian's thoughts.⁵ The cast of De dissidiis (Mi-
nos, Colax, Tiresias, Basilius, Polypragmon, Scipio) is typical of a dialogus
mortuorumThe presence of the speaker-critic, the underworld setting, the
review of souls, the expression of curiosity which motivates the investiga·
tion of the political strife of Europe—Minos asks Tiresias what is happen-
ing on earth to make so many souls descend, “nam animae huc decidunt
tam densae, quam vel grando vehementi aliquo turbine excussa vel folia
flante per auctumnum Borea'‘ (453)—recall similar passages in the Charon
dialogues of Lucian, Pontano and Erasmus, and anticipate Alfonso de
Valdes's Mercurio y Car6n.⁶

To designate Vives’s work as a dialogus mortuoram, however, still leaves
the critic with the question: which kind of dialogue of the dead? Lucian's
literary praxis was not that of his Quattrocento imitators. In fact, some of
the contradictions in Vives's development of this work can only be ex-
plained by the history of the dialogue form and the transformations it
underwent in the hands of the Italian humanists.⁷

³ The old Gregorio Mayans y Siscar Opera Omnia (Madrid, 1782-1790), without
critical apparatus and an apparatussontium, is, as C. Matheeussen explains (Juan Luis
Vives, Early WritingS, ix), outdated. The translation of Lorenzo Riber does not at all
points correspond to the original. Yet in view of the very few editions of De dissidiis,
the lack of a rigorous edition is less critical than in the case of Vives’s more frequently
printed works. All Latin quotes from the De dissidiis are from Opera Omnia, ed.
Gregorio Mayans (Valencia‚ 1783; repr„ London: The Gregg Press, 1964), νοΙ. 6,
452-81.
