376 ERASMUS’S SUSPICloNs or ALEANDER

What was Erasmus's image of Aleander at the beginning of the polem-
ics with Pio in 1525? At the time Erasmus first heard about Pio’s hostile
activities‚ he had already had a somewhat ambivalent and precarious kind
of relationship with Aleander throughout almost two decades. Their
acquaintance dated from their concurrent stay of about six months in
1508 at Aldus’s pn‘nting house in Venice, where they had shared not only
house and board‚ but also their room and even their bed.²⁵ Erasmus was
impressed and fascinated by Aleander's scholarship and his knowledge of
the three theological languages. He assisted at Aleander’s lectures on
Plutarch's Μοναίἱιι.26 An intimate friendship between the two of them

Venice for a career in France, Erasmus strengthened his resolve against all
other advice and willingly provided him with a letter of recommenda-

informed that Erasmus was in Paris and had written a letter to a friend in
Orleans, he felt disappointed not to have been written to by Erasmus, but
he nevertheless immediately travelled to Paris to see his former roommate.
Unfortunately Erasmus had already left the city.32 We know of these
events thanks to Aleander’s first extant letter to Erasmus, in which the
author proves himself fairly content with the development of his career.
No answer from Erasmus, who may have scented some conceit in the
other’s letter, has come down to us.

Again four years later, in 1516, Erasmus was invited to come to Liege,
