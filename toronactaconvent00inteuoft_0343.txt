French Latin:
Literavy Hybridizing in the Renaissance

ROBERT J FINK

he purpose of this paper is, first, to draw attention to an obscure

Latin monograph published anonymously and dated Lyon, 15553
second, after briefly describing the text, to identify its genre as a hybn'd
form and; third, to suggest to you that looking closely at such texts can
help to explain one of the apparent contradictions of the French Renais-
sance: that humanists using classical genres and following the classin
rules and practice of composition in purest Ciceronian Latin actually
contributed to the liberation of their own vernacular writing and eventual-
ly of French literature in general from the constraints of traditional
normative rheton'c.

The text, then, entitled Ad principes christianos cohortatio ριιεῇῐαιιτονιὶι,1
was the work of Jacques Peletier du Mans who by this time was a highly
reputed author of translations, poetry and treatises on a variety of sub-
jects. In 1558, three years after the appearance of the original Latin title,
Parisian publisher Andre Wechel brought out a French version whose text,
apart from a few excerpts discovered in Lacroix du Maine and DuVer-
dier's 132721iothe3qw2fraraoeyse,2 has never been found. There is no reason to
doubt that the French version was by Peletier’s own hand.
