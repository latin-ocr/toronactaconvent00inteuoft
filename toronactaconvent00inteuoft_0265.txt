Thomas Vincent's Paria

STEVEN BERKOWITZ

p aria is a long and complicated comedy. On 3 March 1628, a time of
crisis in England and a time when he should have been doing more
important things, Charles I visited Tn’nity College, Cambridge, and sat
through the play—from ll to 5 o’clock.l According to the epilogue, Paria
had been severely cut for this royal performance.

Paria's plot will sound typical: Lidonia, a nobie widow of Ancona, had
twin sons, Archaicus and Fulgentius. The infant Fulgentius was stolen
away on the day of his father's funeral. He grew up under the care of kind
Laberio, a celibate merchant of Milan. Meanwhile, Archaicus came under
the tutelage of the pedant Master Nicolaus and was taken to Padua for
study, There he met Astraea and Flavia, daughters of the gracious old
merchant Tiberius. Both loved him, while he loved the elder, Astraea.
After wounding one of Flavia‘s local suitors in sels-defense, Archaicus fled
home to Ancona, promising to return within three months. This period
having elapsed, the two sisters separately and secretly traveled to Ancona
