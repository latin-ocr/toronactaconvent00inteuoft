86 ΤΗΟΜΑ8 STAPLETON'S USE OF MORE'S ENGLISH WORKS

some women with child haue such fond lust that thei had leuer eate terre
[that is, tar] than tryacle, 8c rather pitch than marmelade, and some whole
people loue talow better than butter. . . .'’ “Simile'’ recurs in the same
column against 74D.

Horizontal underlining is very frequent. A vertical line draws attention
to longer passages: for instance, the fifteen present participles on 77F
which detail “The paines of death'’⁴¹ and the illusion denounced at 79E
(and at greater length in A Dialogue ‘ff Comfort): “as a man maye see a
thing so far of, that he woteth not whither it be a bushe or a beast.''

Pending a fuller, ideally exhaustive examination of Stapleton's margina-
lia and markings in English Works, I shall turn the pages with you and
pause at representative samples. At 84G, arguing that all the world is a
prison, More reckons pride in one’s forbears “as worshipful, as if a
gentleman thefe when he should goe to Tyburne, wold leue for a me·
moriall, tharmes of his auncesters painted on a post in Newgate.'' Sta-
pleton marks this, as he also does the startling anecdote of a cutpurse who
practises his craft at the very bar of the tribunal on the eve of hanging
from the gallows (column 93CD).

The unsightly fruits of gluttony (column 99BC) inspire More, whose
enumeration twice includes three nouns (“face,'' “skin'' and “body'') with
a triple set of verbs in the present indicative and of epithets, then three
past participles and six present participles (More is a pioneer in the
relentless advance of the -ing form) until we reach, as a climax, the roll of
“diseases‚” some with popular names, others with Greek labels which
smell of the physician's manual: “the dropsy, the colike, the stone, the
strangury, the gout, the cramp, the paulesy, the pocks, the pestilence, and
the apoplexy.’'

Like the two Newgate anecdotes, the next cascade of brief Tacitean
clauses to catch Stapleton's eye derives from More experience as advocate
and undersheriff. It describes, with eight strokes, what happened in early
Tudor England when a slain body was found: “the coroner sitteth‚ the
queste is charged, the verdict geuen, the felony founden, the doer en-
dited, the proces sued, the felon arrained‚ and dyeth for the dead'’
(column lOOH).

In More’s polemical works, Stapleton is less attentive to style; he reacts
as a professional divine to the layman’s arguments. Thus, on page 141 (A
Dialogue concerning Heresies, book 1, chapter 18), the chapter heading

⁴ The whole passage, with a Latin specimen of the “genre,” is quoted in my
“Thomas More et les Chartreux‚” Moreana nos. 95-96 (November 1987): 195.
