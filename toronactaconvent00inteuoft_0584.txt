560 THE DEDICATORY LETTER As A GENRE

comment on the work it accompanies, and so it has little in common for
instance with the accessus. What matters seems to be the relationship
between the writer and his dedicatee‚ The traditional loci include an
ecomium of the dedicatee; praise of the work which has been translated,
compiled or imitated both for its inherent value and for its special signifi-
cance to the recipient; and profuse protestations of the translator’s or
compilator‘s humble status in comparison either with the exalted dedica-
tee or with the author in question. Important is also the effort to connect
one's work to the classical auctores by quotations and allusions of various
kinds. The work is usually said to have been undertaken at the explicit
request of the dedicatee‚ who in return is asked to scrutinize it and judge
its quality, but the exact relationship of the translator! compilator and the
person to whom the book is dedicated is seldom apparent.

Guarino’s Translations of Plutarch ’s Vitae

Guarino Veronese (1374-1460)³ made numerous translations from the
Greek, many of which were later sent to friends or patrons. If we may
judge from quotations in his letters and from the number of translations,
his favorite Greek author was Plutarch, and of his oeuvre Guarino cared
especially for the Lives,⁴ a predilection shared by many at the time. With
emphasis on the Plutarchean translations, Guarino's prefaces will be the
subject of this paper.⁵ By analyzing his letters of dedication Ι shall try to
demonstrate how the established pattern would change according to the

purpose of the gift, and as Guarino's own position in society changed.

³ For the life of Guarino, cf. Remigio Sabbadini, Vita di Guarino Veronese. Giornale
Ligustico 18 (Genovaz Sordo-Muti, 1891), and his La Scuola e gli studi di Guarino
Guarini Veronese (Cataniaz Fr. Galati, 1896). An earlier treatment is in Carlo de'Ros-
mini, Vita e disciplina di Guarino Veronese e de’suoi discepoli, 4 vols. (Bresciaz N. Bettoni,
5- 806 .
180⁴ Flor G)uarin0’s work on Plutarch, cf. Sabbadini, La scuola e gli studi, 130-136.

⁵ The prefaces to Guarino‘s translations are printed in Epistolario di Guarino
Veronese, a c. di Remigio Sabbadini, 3 vols. Miscellanea di Storia Veneta, ser. 3, No. 8,
ll e 14, (Veneziat 1915-1919). I have edited the preface to the Alexander and caesar
in “Guarino, his princely patron, and Plutarch‘s Alexandri ac Caesaris: an ineditum in
Archivio di S. Pietro H 31,” Analecta Romana Instituti Danici XVII-XVIII (1988-1989),
135-49. In the following 1 shall refer to the prefaces edited by Sabbadini only by the
numbers they have in the Epistolario. They are: Flaminius, no. 6; Dion, no. 213 Themisto-
cles, no. 66; Philopoemen, no. 377; Phocion, no. 651; Pelopidas and Marcellus, no. 706;
and Lysander and Sulla, no. 667.
