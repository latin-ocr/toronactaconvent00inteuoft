sixteenth century revived, amplified and revised the natural law teaching
of St. Thomas Aquinas.⁷

Hobbes clearly stands somewhat apart from this tradition, but his
treatise De Cive takes up many of the topics and something of the general
plan of treatises in the tradition, and clearly has a complex relationship of
influence and opposition to it. Pufendorf's De Officio Hominis et Civis
published thirty years after De Cive is an attempt to come to terms with
Hobbes by a student of Grotius‚⁸ and it is clear that in writing several
passages in De Officio, Pufendorf had the very text of De Cive before him,
since there are verbal echoes and close parallels in sequence and structure
of thought.⁹

Pufendorf’s De Officio (1673), together with the large work De Jure
Naturae et Gentium (1672) of which it is a compendium designed for
students, had a large success in its time, going through several editions,
atti-acting ever-increasing layers of commentary and being translated into
all the major European languages.¹⁰ John Locke included both works in
a short list of books on ethics and political though which he recommend-
ed in 1703 as suitable for the education of a gentleman.¹¹ The second of
his two Treatises, though differing profoundly on such questions as the
justification of property and the right of resistance, still follows the form
of Pufendorfs work and discusses many of the same questions. Both of
Pufendorfs books were edited and translated into French by jean Bar-
beyrac. De Jure Naturae et Gentium appeared at Amsterdam in 1706 as Du
dmitdelanatureetdesgensandDeOfficioasLesdevoivsdel'hommeetdu
citoyen in 1707. The former was translated into English complete with
Barbeyrac's notes by Basil Kennett in 1729. Through Barbeyrac in particu-
lar Pufendorf became very well-known in the first half of the eighteenth
century. Among those who studied Barbeyrac's Pufendorf are Mon-
tesquieu, Edward Gibbon, and JearrJacques Rousseau, and in van’ous
editions and commentar-ies Pufendorf's works were widely used as text-
books in European universities until the middle of the century.
