178 LEARNED SCANmNAvrAN WOMEN

cultural phenomenon of the European Renaissance, learned women,
existed and was known and described, also in Scandinavia, during the
period up to around 1800, secondly to have a look at what the learned
women of Scandinavia accomplished‚ and finally, to present examples
from a discussion carried out in Latin, from the beginning of the 18th
century, concerning the way in which a learned woman was to be defined.

within Scandinavia we have knowledge of about 150 learned women.
The majority of these, about 110, are Danish; about 20 Norwegian; and
about 25 Swedish; none as yet from Iceland and Finland. For the most
part, men were the ones who wrote about these women. This is true both
in Scandinavia and in the rest of Europe. Perhaps this has something to
do with the fact that women were clearly expected to conduct themselves
in a humble and modest fashion.

A “gynaeceum’' is a literary genre within the history of learning: a
rational panegyric catalog of women and their intellectual pursuits. Where
Denmark is concerned, Ι am familiar with seven works in this genre,
written during the period from around 1650 to 1800. Four of them are
written in Danish, whereas three are in Latin.² One of the Danish works,
“Haeltinners Pryd’' (The Adornment of Heroines), is written by a woman,
Leonora Christine Ulfeldt (the daughter of King Christian IV), who is to
be numbered among the learned women herself. To my knowledge, her
gynaeceum is the only one in Europe written by a woman.³

The largest printed Latin gynaeceum we have is Albert Thura’s “Gynae·
ceum Daniae litteratum‚'' which was published in Altona in 1732. Albert
Thura has collected a total of 100 women, a number he is extremely
proud of. He has placed several surplus women in an appendix, among
others a few medieval Icelandic women, and in his preface he provides a
separate catalog of female patrons of the arts. Their gifts are often very
modest, but it is the thought that counts when a woman, for example, sets

² The Latin gynaecea are: a) Otto Sperling the younger (1634-1715)‚ De foeminis
doctis. MS in The Royal Library, Copenhagen (Gl. kgl. Saml. 2110 a-b in quarto); b)
Matthias Henriksen Schacht (1660-1700), “Schediasma, exhibens specimen de Eruditis
Mulieribus Daniae‚” in Nova Literaria Maris Baltkici et Septentrionis (Liibeck, 1700),
209-19; c) Albert Thura (1700-40)‚ Gynaeceum Daniae Liueratum, Altona 1732. Cf. M.
Alenius, “Skrifter om laerde danske kvinder,'’ in Litteratur og laerdom. Renaessance-
studier bind l (Copenhagenz Museum Tusculanum Press, 1987), 35-48.

³ Leonora Chrisdna, Hoeltinnm Pryd, ed. Christopher Maaloe (Copenhagenz Det
Danske Sprog- og Litteraturselskab, 1977). Only a fourth of the original work has been
preserved. A portion of it was written while Leonora Christina Ulfeldt (1621-98) was
serving a 22·year prison sentence in Copenhagen. Here she was in contact with the
gynaeceum author Otto Sperling.
