Latin Interpretations of Ptolemy's Geographia

O. A. W. DILKE

Oves a thousand years after Ptolemy’s death, the Greek scholar
Maximus Planudes, at the monastery of Chora, Constantinople,

embarked on a search for manuscripts of Ptolemy’s Manual of Geograplzy.¹
At that time Ptolemy was chiefly known as an astronomer, and some of his
astronomical‚ mathematical and optical writings had been translated into
Latin. But Planudes knew that Greeks, Romans and Arabs had used the
Geogmfflzy, and that it had been accompanied by maps. We knOW, though
he may not have known, that in the tenth century the Arab histon‘an
Al·Mas‘udi had found coloured maps in a Ptolemy manuscript.²
Planudes' search was only partly rewarded: in 1295 he found a text of
it, but no maps. However‚ his manuscript indicated that the text should
have been accompanied by twenty-six maps, and gave Ptolemy’s sugges-
tions for constructing rectangular regional ones according to proportions,
applicable to each region, of longitude and latitude. Planudes therefore
had new maps made; whether they were wholly reconstructed from
Ptolemaic co-ordinates or were also dependent on maps is disputed.³ A
number of copies of the Greek text were made, most with twenty-six or
twenty-seven maps,⁴ but some (known as Recension B) with sixty-four to
