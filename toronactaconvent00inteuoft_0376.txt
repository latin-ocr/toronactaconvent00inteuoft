of rhetoric that appeal primarily to emotions, Aristotle argues for argu-
mentative modes which result in the affirmation or refutation of thought
or in the demonstration of universal ideas. Syllogism and enthymeme are
the means to confirm a thought, and they become for Sigonius tools of
the dialogist. The three types of arguments defined by Aristotle represent,
according to Sigonius, the modes of exposition that the writer of dialogue
is to employ. But the dialogist must adhere to the principles of decorum,
and the interlocutors propose arguments appropriate to their respective
professionS. PhilosopherS, he notes, profess scientific knowledge based
upon demonstration‚ and dialecticians deal with generally accepted
opinions. Whereas philosophers treat of sels-contained, eternal truths,
dialecticians examine probable premisses which, as starting points, result
in an understanding of principle or a definition of elements. Sophists
participate in contentious arguments, seeking victory on premisses that
appear generally accepted but, in reality‚ are misleading.

Theoretically‚ all three sorts of disputants may express their arguments
in dialogic form. Earlier, Sigonius accepted Laertius’s definition of dia-
logue as a “discourse consisting of questions and answers on some philo-
sophical or political subject’' (Life of Plato 348). In shaping subject matter
to a suitable structure, Laertius defines two sorts of dialogues: expositio, or
instructive discourse; inquisitio, or dialectical discussion. Similarly, Sigonius
appropriates the subject matter of dialogue to instruction or examinafion,
and its structure must therefore conform to these purposes. But Aristode,
in his Sophistical Refutations (165 a38-bll), designates four sorts of dis·
course used in dialogue: didactic‚ dialectic, examination-arguments, and
contentious arguments. Thus, Sigonius must accommodate Aristotle's
analyses of argumentation to Laertius’s thoughts on dialogic structure.
According to Sigonius, sophistical or contentious arguments are inappro-
priate to the genre; and he compresses the other modes of argumentation
to Laertius's expositio (instructive demonstration) and inquisitio (dialectic
discussion and examination-arguments).

Expositio‚ as Sigonius terms the demonstrative dialogue, is adapted to
the purpose of instruction. After the postulation of the topic, the interloc-
utors examine the existence, nature, causes, and consequences of the
subject under discussion. A thesis, or principle, emerges from the initial
proposition; and, as debate ensues, interlocutors express opinions. At the
end of the discussion, though, the varying thoughts return to the initial
principle, thereby instructing the reader or listener in the ramiflcations of
the subject which has been demonstrated through analysis and synthesis.
Sigonius does not limit demonstrative debate to particular topics; and, like
Laertius, he views such thematically diverse dialogues as Plato's Timaeus,
