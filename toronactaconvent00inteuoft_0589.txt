MARIANNE PADE 565

de’Rossi which will make him consent to be the judge of Guarino's
work,¹⁷ and when Guarino dared to send the Alexander and Caesar to a
prospective patron, it was again because of the humanitas of the recipi-
ent.¹⁸ In the first case the word is connected with mansuetudo, in the
second with comitas. In a solemn passage where Guarino praises Leonello's
virtues, he calls him humanissime princeps, referring amongst other things
to Leonello’s mansuetudo, clementia and similar virtues.¹⁹ Elsewhere too,
Guarino invokes Leonello’s humanitas.²⁰ Here and in Guarino’s other
writings, it seems that humanitas is a virtue which belongs to patrons or
persons of high social rank, presumably (one might venture to guess)
because it was more important to invoke this virtue with people in power.
In Guarino's description of Leonello, it appears that one way to achieve
humanitas, mansuetudo, and clementia is through the imitation of great men,
in other words, the reading of history. Here we find the connection
between learning and human qualities which is so important in Coluccio
Salutati's definition of humanitas.²¹

If the differences in social standing were great enough, then humanitas
was important as a mediator between Guarino and the dedicatee. Their
relationship may also be described in terms of munificentia and gratia:
Francesco Barbaro had presented Guarino with a Greek manuscript of
Plutarch, and as a token of his gratia, Guarino sent to Barbaro the Dion,
although it was not an adequate return for the gift;²² and when citizen-
ship had been granted to Guarino in Ferrara, the dedication to Leonello
