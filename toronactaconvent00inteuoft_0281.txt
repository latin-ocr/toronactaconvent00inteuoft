psychological motives as a means of possibly exorcising the inner conflicts
within his own identity.

Six years later the literary and intellectual landscape of Germany had
changed dramau‘cally. The tensions between humanism and scholasticism
had broken out, coming to a head in the so-called Reuchlin affair, that
bitter controversy between the Cologne Dominicans and Johann Pfeffer-
korn on one side and the eminent scholar Johannes Reuchlin and a large
segment of the German humanists on the other. Ulrich von Hutten first
became an attentive spectator and later one of the most active participants
in that acrimonious debate, shaping the perceptions of his contemporaries
about this conflict more than any other humanist.

The literary fruit of the Reuchlin affair were the Epistolae obscurorum
virorum, a fictitious correspondence presumably written by monks, scholas-
tics and theologians but actually composed by Crotus Rubeanus and
Ulrich von Hutten who wrote the majority of the letters of Part 11, includ-
ing the letter which contains the poem, the satin‘cal “Carmen rithmicale'’
we are dealing with in this paper.¹l

The fiction of the letter is that a certain Philipp Schlauraff is sent by the
Cologne theologians on a public relations tour to various humanist centers
in Germany in order to enlist the help of scholars against the hated Reuch-
linists. Schlauraff chooses to describe his experiences in a lengthy poem <185
lines), which, with its intentionally awkward meter (it approximates the leo-
nine hexameter), naive mixture of Latin and German and barbarous Latin,
is the very opposite of Hutten’s elegant idiom modelled on the classical
Roman poets.¹²

Schlauraffs fictitiousjourney starts in Wittenberg, goes via Rostock and

Walther Brecht, Die Versasser der Epistolae obscurorum virorum (Strabburg‚ 1904). In
addition to the standard arguments advanced by Brecht and Bomer, there are two
more reasons suggesting why Hutten was the author of this particular letter. First we
have the testimony of Johannes Cochlaeus, who on 9 September 1516 wrote to
Willibald Pirckheimer: “1 am sending you the Marcus of Hutten who dined with us
tonight and read to us some new letters amid great laughter. By means of those letters
one wandered through almost all Germany. He also mentioned you (in this letter)
because you had written against usury which our master (Johannes Eck is meant)
discussed in a disputation in Bologna. Hutten, however, denies that he is the author”
(Bocking 1:126). The fact that Hutten denied having authored the letters was an under-
standable precaution at a time when the letters were about to be banned because of the
anticlerical tone. The most convincing argument, however, for Hutten's authorship are
the remarkable affinities and similarities in structure and “cast’' between the two poems.
