As expected, Grotius tells us that “in agreements that are not odious
the words should be taken with their full meaning according to current
usage; and, if there are several meanings, that which is broadest should be
chosen, just as the masculine gender is taken for the common gender, and
an indefinite expression for a universal’' (414).

Grotius’s fourth topic is what he calls “interpretation from conjectures
outside of the meaning of the words in which the promise is contained’‘
(421). By “outside the meaning” he means beyond the range of ordinary
and proper signification. This kind of interpretation consists in broaden-
ing or narrowing the sense of a term if the result otherwise would be
unjust, unlawful or demonstrably contrary to the maker's intent.

Among other exasnples of broad or extensive interpretation, Grotius
gives what he takes to be a stock illustration‚ the condition in a will that an
expected posthumous child has died. Suppose that in fact no posthumous
child is born; then the condition is understood by extension to cover that
situation, since it is presumed that the maker wanted to provide for the
non-existence of a child, not merely for the death of an existing child.
Grotius adds the comment, “It is, in fact, possible to find this very exam-
ple in the writings not only of the jurists but also of Cicero and Valerius
Maximus” (422), as if to suggest that its appearance in the latter two
authors somehow gives it greater value. As an example of narrow or
restrictive interpretation, Grotius says that “a person who has promised to
return a sword which he received in trust will not return it to a madman,
lest he bring danger either to himself or to other innocent persons” (425).
He cites Quintilian for this example, which is at least as old as Plato’s
Republic (331C).

At the end of this part of his chapter, Grotius adds the following
statement, in which he mentions Roman law for the first and last time in
the body of the text. “I shall not . . . admit the rule, which has been
adopted by some writers [meaning Alciati in particular]‚ that the contracts
of kings and peoples ought to be interpreted according to Roman law as
far as possible, unless it is apparent that among certain peoples the body
of civil law has been received as the law of nations in respect to the
matters which concern the law of nations. Such a presumption ought not
rashly to be admitted’' (429).

Finally, in the very last section of the chapter, we find what 1 have
called the fifth main topic, the presumption in favor of the promisor in an
obscure agreement. Whether more weight should be given to the words of
one who offers or of the one who accepts a condition, Grotius tells us, is
a point which interests Plutarch in his Symposiacs. The one who accepts
or promises ought to be favored‚ he argues, because the mere offer of a
condition creates no obligation unless it is accepted. This reasoning is not
