170 THE JEPHTHAH TRAGl-:msss

five acts, each concluded by a lyric sung by a rey. This change has great
consequences, as it diminishes the number of structural units from the 14
of Buchanan’s Iephthes (prologue, 7 episodes and 6 choral odes) to 5 in
Vondel (for the reyen are more closely linked to the preceding acts than
the odes in Buchanan to the preceding episodes). In this way the attention
shifts from the thoughts, emotions and narratives which form the contents
of Buchanan’s episodes and odes to the characters and their mental states
which are central in Vondel‘s acts. To illustrate this shift one instance may
suffice: in the first act of Vondel'sJeptha, the “Slotvoogd,'' a kind of major
domus intimately connected with Jephthah and his wife, arrives as a
messenger from the Judge to report to his wife the victory gained by her
husband. The spouse reacts to the report and so remains the central
figure of the act. Buchanan had the victory reported to the chorus by an
abstract nuntius. In his treatment the narrative coincides with the episode.

2. Vondel's Jeptha has no prologue, which means that the externa}
biblical perspective on the dramatic events is lacking. In tbi.. way the play
loses the nature of a biblical message, which, on the other hand, it certain-
ly had in Buchanan's concept. One can even doubt whether the Jeptha is
a biblical drama at all. Vondel, at any rate, in this case took his subject
matter not from the Bible but from the Scots humanist's text.

3. The sparing commonplace character of Buchanan’s text,—i.e., its
typical Latin style, is in Vondel dissolved into a profuse, rich poetry that
in transformation loses a great deal of its dialectical force.

4. Vondel’s narrative of events is crammed with realistic details unthink-
able in Buchanan. Owing to these last two distinctions Vondel'sJeptha is
much longer than Buchanan's Iephthes: 1978 against 1450 verses.

5. Vondel's characters have ceased to function as allegorical references
and have lost their inconsistency; in Buchanan's play these aspects were
created by the varying affects and thoughts of the cast. In Vondel, howev-
er, they are no longer pieces on the rhetorical—allegorical chessboard. His
drama is centred in the characters themselves.

6. The ethical and religious thesis of Buchanan's play,—i.e., its topical
political meaning—is missing altogether. Vondel's drama is about individu-
al men and their acts.

7. The most striking change Buchanan's play underwent in Vondel’s
imitatio appears in the plot. Vondel has restored the two-months' delay of
the biblical story, which had been requested by the daughter and granted
her to bewail her virginity in the mountains. The play commences Just
before dawn as this period draws to its close. In these two months Jeph·
thah has fought and won a second battle, this time against the Ephraimites
(Judges 12:1-6). The mother fills up the entire first act. She is awaiting the
