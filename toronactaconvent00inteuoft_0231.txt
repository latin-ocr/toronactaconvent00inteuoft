hectic environment. Yet Mulcaster is resolutely in favour of this public
education, and brings forth all the ancient authorities to attack the notion
of private instruction. He is a supportes of a strong central state that
retains hierarchy but that does not give undue worth to any degree except
for the monarchy itself. In his mind evevyone is to go to the state schools.
Even women, in his tortured and ambivalent chapter on the education of
girls, must have some contact with the classrooms of the state.

Τὴε whole program of sports fits into his more general claims. The
schools will retain the best of the older education of the gentleman, but
they will not be just for the gentlemen or the wealthy. Yet how can he
present his argument? He cannot argue that horseback n'ding and fencing
must be taught because these are socially correct. This would undercut his
argument that they should be open to all. So he has undertaken a differ-
ent approach. These sports will be practised‚ along with many others,
because they are medically sound. The whole social aspect of sports is ob-
scured by an apparently scientific argument in their favour. Yet this
scientific—or perhaps one should say pseudo-scientific—argument for
sports is really part of Mulcaster's rheton'cal method. What is accepted
method for one end in Mercuriale becomes reused but entirely redirected
in Mulcaster. In other words, everything the medical humanist Mercuriale
says about a sport is intended to disseminate and increase medical knowl-
edge; everything the educational propagandist Mulcaster says—no matter
how scientific or how well supported by authorities—is used as part of a
defence of a uniform system of public education. In the shift of emphasis
we see one way Neo—Latin scholarship is adapted for vernaculas needs in
sixteenth-century England.
