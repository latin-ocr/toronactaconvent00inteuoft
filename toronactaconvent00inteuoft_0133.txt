LAUREL CARRchoN 1 15

must soberly negotiate among the levels of probability applying to compet—
ing propositions. In the course of these duties, the use of ornament is
introduced to decorate and to delight.

It is as an ornament that Erasmus describes metaphor in Pambolae. In
so doing, he is speaking along lines established by the ancient rhetoricians‚
who classify metaphor as a trope or figure of speech, all of which are
described as ornaments. Thus it should be our task at this point to under-
stand something about the role of ornament in classical rheton‘c. Both
Cicero and Quintilian see it as something added on to plain speech: as
Cicero’s Crassus specifies,

tantum significabo brevi, neque verborum ornatum inveniri posse
non partis expressisque sententiis neque esse ullam sententiam
illustrem sine luce verborum.¹²

According to this passage, one should first determine in basic form what
one wishes to say, and then afterward embellish one's speech. In other
words, ornament does not enter into the first stages of putting an idea
into speech. Neither should it seem detached from the language in which
it appears: for example, in speaking of metaphor, Quintilian writes,

Quae quidem cum ita est ab ipsa nobis concessa natura, ut indocti
quoque ac non sentientes ea frequenter utantur, tum ita iucunda atque
nitida, ut in oratione quamlibet clam proprio lumine eluceat.¹³

The ornament of metaphor is rooted here in a concept of speech that is
“natural.'‘ What Quintilian appears to mean by “natural’' in this passage
is something along the lines of “spontaneous” or “unstudied,” in spite of
the fact that elsewhere he recommends a careful, three-step approach to
ornamentation.¹⁴ Metaphor has the peculiar advantage that it is at the
same time distinguished, and yet natural—it is an ornament that does not
seem to be.

This rather contradictory desire that speech be at the same time
distinguished and natural haunts the imagination of writers long after
Quintilian. Erasmus picks up on Quintilian’s ideal of “natural'’ speech
when he writes a letter to Anthony of Luxembourg, praising his style:

¹² Cicero, De Oratore 3524.
¹³ Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria 8.6.4.
¹⁴1bid. 8.3.61: “Ornatum est, quod perspicuo ac probabili plus est. Eius primi sunt

gradus in eo quod velis [concipiendo et] exprimendo, tertius, qui haec nitidiora faciat,
quod proprie dixeris cultum.”
