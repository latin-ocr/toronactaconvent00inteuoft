pars huius calamitatis,” “that messenger of papal bulls, great part of your
soul, and in my view, actor of great parts in these catastrophic events.”¹⁸

The Diplomatophorus returns, again without further indication, in
Erasmus’s Apology against Pio’s last and posthumously edited work, the
exceptionally voluminous “Of Alberto Pio the most illustrious and by far
the most learned Count of Carpi, Twenty—three Books, not counted the
preface and the epilogue, against the places in the various works of Eras-
mus that should in his opinion be revised and withdrawn.‘’¹⁹ In Eras-
mus’s Apology, however, we encounter another, rather malicious hint as
to Pio’s presumed accomplices that can only be understood as pointing to,
amongst others, Aleander: “1 easily accept that Pio in Rome wrote against
me on the instigation of some others, whose identity does not escape me;
one is aJewish man, people Ι never could well get along with.”²⁰

The insinuation that Aleander was Jewish by descent, seems to occur
for the first time in 1520 in the Acta Academiae Louaniensis contra Lu-
therum. This pamphlet was anonymously published at Cologne in view of
the coming Diet of worms, probably during the days both Erasmus and
Aleander were in Cologne, OctsNov. 1520. Although the Acta later were
included in the collected works of Luther, its authorship has to be as-
cn‘bed to Erasmus.²¹ The introductory letter to the Acta gives a very
unsympathetic portrait of Aleander as being ofJewish descent, ironically
adding that he possibly was not even baptised and, to judge from his
behaviour, certainly did not believe in resurrection.²² The Acta itself
names Aleander as belonging to the same brood asJudas Iscarioth, willing
to betray the cause of the Gospel, even for three instead of thirty drach-
mes.²³ That Erasmus was the first to call Aleander aJew, seems to be
confirmed by Hutten's charge in his Expostulatio against Erasmus and by
Aleander's complaint‚ as reported by Erasmus in his Spongia, his refutation
of Hutten’s charge.²⁴
