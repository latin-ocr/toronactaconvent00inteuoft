Grotius himself, I am convinced, being extraordinarily well versed in
the classics and fully trained as a lawyer, must have been aware that in
reconstructing the theory of legal interpretation he was plundering the
past rather than improving on it. But if his aim was to provide a theoreti-
cal basis for international relations, free from the traditional imperialisms
which were in contentiori with the new idea of national sovereignty, he
had to provide something which looked new even if it was not really new.
He was trying to reach a general international audience, not a special
professional one. If his argument was challenging and intriguing but not
obviously sound, that fact may have contributed to his success. All partici-
pants in the modern debate over political theory have found support in
his work and have found something to criticize. Hence, if his ambivalent
attitude toward the legal tradition was a fault, it was perhaps a fortunate
fault. He brought old ideas in jurisprudence, clothed in non-technical
language, to the attention of the general readerÍ¾ and by choosing his
illustrative examples from the remote past, he managed to avoid taking
sides in the political and religious controversies of his own time. Thus his
voice seemed to be the voice of pure natural reason, but the message it
conveyed was an ancient and traditional one.
