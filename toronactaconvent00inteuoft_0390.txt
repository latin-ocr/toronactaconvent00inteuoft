366 ERASMUS'S EARLY PSALM COMMENTARIES

exegesis which the material, and his own current preoccupations, seemed
to warrant. But what literary criteria did he use to arrive at a general
estimate of the psalmist's meaning? Erasmus seems to have regarded
oratory as more useful, indeed more salutary‚ than dialectic in the exposi-
tion of theology,⁷ and in the commentary on the First Psalm he discusses
the preacher's choice of language, which should aim to produce a lasting
impression on the audience, even at the expense of precision: “some
words are more impressive than others, some more meaning-ful, some
more impassioned, some more pleasant; very important to the preacher is
a knowledge of the rhetorical figures' ‘.[190D] ⁸ The vital thing is to avoid
the brain- -numbing dullness of the Scotists.

In fact Erasmus the satirist and dialogist is well attuned to the dramatic
style of the Psalms and takes delight ln analysing their rhetorical twists and
turns. He identifies antithesis as the basic figure in the Psalms, in which
admonition to the wicked alternates with consolation to the faithful, but
he also comments on the psalmist's exploitation of such figures as periph-
rasis, anaphora, synecdoche, hypallage, and metonymy.⁹ Above all, Eras-
mus the literary critic appreciates the metaphorical qualities of the Psalms,
and defends stoutly what some commentators had seen as a frivolous and
unbecoming usage. He is well aware, for example, that the divine nature
is changeless and unmoving, but accepts that the frequent attribution of
human characteristics to God in the psalms was a means of increasing
understanding: God’s wrath and laughter in the Second Psalm, for exam-
ple, convey most vividly the effect on us of his vengeance, and his capacity
for irony, for instance in frustrating the Jews' elaborate plots against
Christ [2122 216E-F and cf. 256FJ. At one point he criticises St. Hilary,
who objected austerely to metaphorical utterances about Christ, such as
the First Psalm's description of him as a tree [173D-F and cf. 185A];
Erasmus's pedagogy had always stressed the usefulness of vivid and lifelike
imagery. In expounding the typology of the Psalms, Erasmus also exploits
the fact that the range of Hebrew metaphor is very limited, mostly to

(Toronto, 1977), 55 and 63 ff.; this subject was discussed at the Toronto congress in
the seminar on Erasmus and literary criticism (papers by Erika Rummel, Laurel
Carrington, and Robert D. Sider) and in the paper by Dominic BakerSmith.

Balbulus: see Notkeri poetae liber ymnorum, ed. W. von den Steinen (Berne and Munich,
