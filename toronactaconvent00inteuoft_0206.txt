literature or esthetics expressed themselves in the vernaculas it was in the
form of poetic texts.

Birgitte Thott's huge manuscript “Om et lyksaligt liv'’ (“On a Blissful
Life”)‚ comprising 200 folio leaves, is unique.¹¹ It is written in Danish,
with 50 chapters. The work is filled to the brim with references to the
founding fathers of the church, the moral philosophers and not least the
antique philosophers. Birgitte Thott harvests from the classical literature
while simultaneously weaving in local material. In this respect it is a typical
piece of Renaissance literature and could easily have been written in Latin.
Seen from the point of view of Danish national literatus, however, it is
atypical. Denmark has a wealth of small educational works based on the
Bible, but a “De vita beata,'' which unites Christianity and stoicism as this
one does, as if it were written by Justus Lipsius, is not known otherwise.

Birgitte Thott's intention is to educate the individual person with
regard to moral responsibility in relation to one’s self and to others. But
it is not only the individual as such that is to be educated and to be given
support by Cicero and Aristotle. Birgitte Thott has a particular social
group in mind: the women. To this end she draws support from Plutarch
and Seneca. Under the protection of these two knights she marches
forward as the first advocate of women's rights in Scandinavia. Quite
unexpectedly, amidst the regular basic questions of a philosophical nature,
she smuggles in two chapters (chapters 45 and 46) “on the use of studies’'
and on “how correct utilization of studies is beneficial and by no means
detrimental to women.'‘ She agitates for the woman’s right to study and
for the good inssuence of studies on the individual who desires to attain to
virtue. Like the Spanish humanistJuan Luis Vives and like Schurman, she
stresses the fact that studies cannot be detrimenta] to women, and like
them, she does not demand political rights for women. She is interested
in the woman's right to have access to knowledge. She rejects arguments
to the effect that women are not good at learning and shows how the two
sexes are treated differently already in their upbringing as children. She
points out that while the girls were kept to their household chores and
advised against wasting their time on books, the boys were dragged off to
instruction, whether they wanted to be or not. The preface to her Seneca
translation is even dedicated to women. Here she points out that it is

¹¹ The work is unpublished. The original has been lost, presumably burned in the
Soro Academy fire in 1832 together with other works and her correspondence. Two

extant copies, almost contemporary, are found in Karen Brahes Bibliotek in Land-
sarkivet for Fyn, Denmark (A VI, 19 and A VI, 20).
