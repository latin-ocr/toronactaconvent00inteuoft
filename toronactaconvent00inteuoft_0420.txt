396 THE ANTI-LUCRETIUS OF MELCHIOR DE POLIGNAC

early held in esteem by Voltaire, though he was later to call it a “poeme
sans poesie, et philosophie sans raison.''⁶

Polignac’s treatment of the fundamental principles of Epicureanism and
Lucretius’s exposition of them is comprehensive. The first book of the
poem is a vehement attack upon Epicurean ethics and the concept of
pleasure (voluptas) as the summum bonum to Polignac, unconvinced by
attempts to restore Epicureanism to an original purity, it is nothing but a
selfish and corrupting devotion to lust. In the second and third books
Polignac attacks the two pillars of Epicurean physicS, void and atoms.
Book 4 is devoted to a criticism of atomic motion and in particular the
Epicurean notion of a clinamen or swerve of atoms designed to account
both for creation and for freedom of will. Book 5 is a reply to the third
book of the De Rerum Natura in which Lucretius argues for the mortality
of the soul. The sixth book is an engaging digression in which Polignac
enters the ongoing debate concerning the nature of animal soul, inclining
to the Cartesian view of the animal as an automaton. The seventh book
treats the question of the generation and reproduction of animals and
Polignac uses the genetic theories of Swammerdam against Epicurean and
Aristotelian explanations. The eighth and last complete book of the poem
offers an impressive survey of the astronomical advances of the age, in
which Polignac defends the Copernican system and heaps praise upon
Galileo, Tycho Brahe, Huygens, and above all Kepler.

A full assessment of Polignac's critique of the essentials of Epicurean
physics would require an examination of all of books 2-4 of the poem.
However, at the n'sk of doing some disservice to the author, but in the
interest of economy, we may get the measure of Polignac's approach from
an examination of his treatment of atoms in book 3.

Book 3 opens with a brief summary of the principal features of the
Epicurean concept of atoms: they are the smallest units of matter, eternal,
independent and indivisible; they are infinite in number because the
existence of an infinite void demands it: if the number of atoms within an
infinite void were finite, then the creation of compound bodies through a
protmcted process of fortuitous atomic combinations could never have taken
place, nor could created things avoid destruction.⁷ Further, the atoms are

⁷ See De Rerum Natura 1.1008-51 (cf. Epicurus, Ep. ad Hdt. 42), where Lucretius
makes the following points not summarised by Polignac: (a) that because of the
ceaseless motion of the atoms those at the outer edge of the world are ejected into the

surrounding cosmos, and unless there is a constant supply of new atoms entering from
the outside‚ the world will gradually be diminished (1029-41), and (b) that these new
