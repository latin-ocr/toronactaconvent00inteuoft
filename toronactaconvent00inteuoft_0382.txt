558 SCALIGER, νΙΝΕΤ, AND THE TEXT or Ausomus

some 300 useful emendations. In about forty-five cases the attribution of
emendations to one or the other has proved controversial. Editors by and
large give Scaliger the credit for these, but Vinet was vigorously champi-
oned by the French scholar Henri de la Ville de Mirmont‚³ who is fol-
lowed at a cautious distance by Anthony Grafton in his recent biography
of Scaliger.4 More about de la Ville de Mirmont (henceforth “Mirmont'')
in a moment, but first let me present a few facts about the case. Scaliger
worked on the text of Ausonius during the summer of 15733 he published
his Ausonianae Lectiones in 1574 and a text in 1575. Both were printed at
Lyons by Antoine Greyff.⁵ Vinet began his second edition in about 1562,
and sent it to Greyff at the latter‘s request in 1567 or 1568. It was never
printed there, but appeared at Bordeaux, coming from the new press of
Simon Millanges first in a very small edition in 1575 and then together
with a large commentary in 1580.⁶ Scaliger was thus the first into print:
his Ausonianae Lectiones preceded Vinet's text by about a year, and his text,
which did not in fact incorporate all his emendations, preceded it by a
month or so. So it seems that editors are right to attach Scaliger's name to
the disputed emendations, unless there is good evidence that Vinet made

them first. Mirmont thought there was good evidence, so I now turn back
to him.

The fact that such a valuable manuscript of Ausonius should have
ended up at Leyden seemed strange and rather irksome to French schol-
ars of the late nineteenth century. One of them, Reinhold Dezeimeris,
hoped to get it back, but was unsuccessful.⁷ As a pis aller a faesimile of it
was produced under the direction of Mirmont. Not content with that,
Mirmont added an introductory volume and two volumes of detailed
commentary in which he assembled all the emendations known to him of
the text of the manuscript. His second aim, as a bitter preface makes
clear, was to rescue Vinet from the dishonour placed on him by Scaliger
