JAN N. PENDERGRASS 579

Α further excerpt of the same letter informs us that de Pins had once
been, in Paris, a student of Girolamo Balbi, with whom Calcagnini had
become acquainted during his recent sojourn in Hungary.²⁹ We can
therefore assume that our humanist had studied under Balbi, in or shortly
prior to 1493, at approximately the same time he had introduced himself
to the Parisian humanist Robert Gaguin.³⁰ Tbere are further letters or
excerpts from Girolamo Fondulo (nos. II.l, 112), Erasmus (nos. 11.3, 11.4,
11.5, 11.6, 11.12), Germain de Brie (no. 11.4)‚ cardinal Lorenzo Pucci (no.
11.7), archbishop Federico Fregoso (no. ΙΙ.8) and Agostino Giusn'niani (no.
119), bishop of Nebbio and farned professor of Hebrew sojourning in
Pan's from 1517 to 1522.³¹

These final letters are then followed by Graverol’s remarks, as has been
stated, and a list of “incipits” from various speeches, official translations
and miscellaneous writings that Graverol had not found the leisure to
transcribe from the original Codex. The final piece of the collection is a
seventeeth-century letter from Marquis de Pins to the Grand Vicar of
Pamiers, listing what little knowledge he had been able to accumulate
concerning his illustrious ancestor. He, too, indicates knowledge of the
original manuscript, yet does not appear to have been able to locate it.³²

as April 15, 1517 (cf. Revue d'Histoire Diplomatique 61, p. 245). His request is later
mentioned in a letter to chancellor Antoine Du Prat (no. 59) dated from Venice,
March 13 (probably 1519). Cf. Marino Sanuto, 1 diarii, edd. N. Barozzi et al. (Venice,
1879-1903), xxvii, col. 629, 630.

²⁹ tum verum ob praeclaram hominis iuius memoriam, qui ut te discipulum olim
dum in Gallia Parisiis ageret, sic me posthac in Pannonia aequalem et amicum
praecipuum habet (Marginal note, Ms. 215: fol. 169v). Caloegnini had accompanied
Ippolito d'Este to Hungary in 1517, remaining there probably until late 1518.
