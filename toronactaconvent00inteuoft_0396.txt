372 ERASMus’s SUSPICIONS or ALEANDER

monks and theologians, willing to scrutinize severely every line written by
their most hated antagonist.²

Apart from these anonymous assistants, however, Erasmus assumed one
particular and all but nameless instigator to be behind the work of the
Italian Sunday theologian. He had connected the name of this presumed
instigator with that of Pio from the very beginning, in 1525, of the long
lasting polemics. In a later period he even remembered that already in
1520, five years before the polemics started, he had been informed of the
hostile activities of an imperial legate, a “Caesaris Orator,'' in Rome. He
only then realized that this legate was no other than the Prince of Carpi,
whose later activities were evidently inspired by the very same informer of
that time.³ This informer had been the controversial messenger of the
papal bull against Luther at the Diet of Worms, the “diplomatophorus,”
as Erasmus ironically used to call him in this connection, Jerome
Aleander.⁴

Even before the name of Pio occurs in Erasmus's correspondence, his
trouble-making conversation in Rome was connected by Erasmus with
Aleander. Allen quite naturally identifies the anonymous Italian critic who,
in a letter in August 1524, is said to have publicly proclaimed all over
Rome that he by far preferred the scholarship of Aleander to that of
Erasmus, even in the field of theology‚⁵ as the Prince of Carpi. In reac-
tion to these rumours, Erasmus decided to approach Aleander directly in
writing‚ to assure him that, far from being jealous, he could only feel
honoured to be compared with such a great scholar as his addressee.⁶
Even if irony is not lacking in this letter, nevertheless Erasmus seems to a
certain extent to be sincere, since a few days before he had written in the
same vein to an impartial countryman.⁷

In the next year, 1525, Erasmus appears to know about the identity of

other designations are amanuensis, artifex, collector, congestor‚ delator, famuli,
famulitium, pharmacologus, rhapsodus, schediastes, sycophanta, and indefinite
indications such as quisquis, monachus aut theologus quispiam, etc.
