730 LATIN EP1GRAMs ON ETIENNE DOLET

tant for the history of scholarship and printing, as well as for his eventful
life (which included five spells in prison, mostly on religious charges) and
momentous death (he was executed in 1546, supposedly for denying the
immortality of the soul).³ Often‚ these epigrams say as much about the
people who wrote them as they do about Dolet. This is to the best of my
knowledge the first attempt to list them, and 1 hope in due course to pub-
lish them.⁴ Since the poems are by definition short, it seems sufficient to
give the author's name in references: the sources are cited in an appendix.

Dolet was distinctive (and hence an appropriate subject for epigrams)
in three ways. Firstly for his scholarship and prowess as a wn'ter. Many of
the epigrams on Dolet deal with this. For some commentators‚ his Fata
Francisci regis qualified him as the new Virgil and his De Imitatione Cice-
roniana as the new Cicero. For Godefroy Beringier, Dolet is the equal of
both Cicero and Virgil.⁵ Guillaume Durand declares that his Latin poetry
is the equal of that of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Nicholas Bourbon,

³ Dolet was imprisoned (a) in Toulouse, in March 1534, on a charge of exciting a
riot and contempt for the Parlement; (b) after the murder of the painter Henri Guillot
(or Guillaume), known as Compaing, 31 December 1536; (c) in July or August 1542,
on suspicion of heresy, probably at the instigation of printers at Lyons; (d) on 6
January 1544, after two packets of heretical books addressed to Dolet had been seized
on entry into Paris, and an order for his arrest sent to Lyons (he escaped two days
later to Piedmont); and (e) after publishing his Second Enser with his translations of
Axiochus and Hipparchus. See R. C. Christie, Etienne Dolet, the martyr os the Renaissance,
a biography, London, 1880, respectively 1313 296-3133 401-3‚ where the charges are
related (he was released in October 1543); 4253 431-61. He was arrested for the last
time either at Lyons or at Troyes by 7 September 1544, condemned principally for his
translation osa passage of the Axiochus which taken in isolation denies the immortality
of the soul, and condemned to death on 2 August 1546. Nor were these his only
unfriendly encounters with authority: see Christie, 154-55 (his retreat from Toulouse
to avoid a second arrest there), 157-58 (his banishment from Toulouse) and 385
(trouble over Cato Christianus and epigrams).

⁴ Michael Maittaire compiled a collection of biographical statements on Dolet,
including some epigrams, in his Annales typographici‚ 5t., Hagae Comitum, 1715 (BL.
823 h), III, i, 9-113, which I have drawn on. Another very useful source is Claude
Longeon’s Bibliographie des oeuvres d’Etiemze Dolet, Geneve, 1980.

⁵ On Dolet as a latter-day Virgil and Cicero, see the flattering comment os
Beringier in the epigram cited above, and the sardonic remark of Scaliger in his
Poetices libri septem, cited by Maittaire (ΙΙΙ, i, 16): “[. . .] suo arbitratu Vergilianas
gemmas suae inserit pici, ut videri velit sua. Ignavus loquutulejus, qui ex tessellis
Ciceronis sebriculosas quasdam conferruminavit (ut ipse vocat) orationes; ut docti
iudicant, latrationes: putavit tantum licere sibi in divinis operibus Virgilianis.” On
echoes of Virgil in Dolet, see V.J. Worth, “Etienne Dolet: from a neo-Latin epic poem
to a chronicle in French prose,” in Ι. D. McFarlane, ed., Acta Conventus Neo-Latini

Sanctandreani (Binghamton‚ 1986), 423-29.
