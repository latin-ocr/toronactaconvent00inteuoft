342 VIVES' EARLY WRITINGS

the title of the historical work just described (“Christi Iesu fecimus
γενεθλιακόν, eo dumtaxat tempore, quo et ipse natus est, et alii rerum
humanarum passim fata praenuntiant”). But there is a noteworthy varia-
tion from the use of the Janus-reference in the De tempore, where the
information had confirmed the connection between sacred and secular
history. The Genethliacon‚ rather, asserts emphatically that it is sacred not
secular history which is in control, and that the peace signified by the
temple closing is temporary at best. Mary says:

Quid quaeso sibi vult Iani Quirini, seu potius Monstri cuiusdam,
tertium ab Octavio clausa nostris diebus porta, velut non mox
saevissima bella Romanis secutura sint? Hinc, hinc pax orietur ex
humili lutea casula, non vasto marmore, auro, ac gemmis refulgenti
Romano capitolio . . . . (Geneth. p. 10)

A true symbol becomes a secular deception. Vives contravenes the
relationship between sacred and secular history he had posited in the De
tempore, even though we have seen one hint that he might have had his
mind on the one piece while composing the other. The assumption, then,
that the Genethliacon is no later than New Year’s 1519 again gives us a
picture of progression in literary competence from the Genethliacon to the
Aedes and the Somnium: this time, from looser to more systematic incorpo-
ration of literary inventiveness with scholarly analysis.

The above remarks suggest, I hope, that a clearer picture of Vives'
literary and personal development can indeed be hoped for by expanding
the method applied here to his other early writings. Further‚ there is some
pertinence to chronological questions. A hypothesis of stylistic develop-
ment proceeding from the Genethliacon to the Aedes to the Somnium, if
sound, corroborates Matheeussen's implicit argument that New Year's day
1520 is an improbably late date for the Genethliacon (see note 1 above). In
addition, the similarity of topic but the clash in some details of treatment
between the De tempore and the Genethliacon raises questions about how
much time lapsed between the two compositions. Norena assumes they
both refer to the same Christmas season.⁷ If they do, Vives will have put
the symbol of the temple ofJanus to radically different uses in two pieces
composed simultaneously or nearly so. This may have happened: but the
detail urges us to leave room for the alternative mentioned by Matheeus—
sen, that the “December l5l8” date for the De tempore may also refer to
