704 THE EMBLEMs or CRANACH AND VAENIUS

Thus minous sensuality enslaves the will of the great one,
And passion weakens the strong heast by its effeminacy.¹¹

This painted emblem clearly warns through ridicule against the dangers
for males of sexual passion. The distaff held by Hercules is the traditional
symbol of the female sex and has been substituted in this painting for the
hero’s usual phallic club. The bearded hero’s dress, obviously inappropri-
ate for a military hero, is that of a Renaissance lady.

In apparent contrast to these orthodox views of a piously loveless or a
foolishly lovelorn Hercules, we find three later emblems by the artist Otto
van Veen in his 1608 Emblemes of Love, a work very much influenced by
Renaissance Platonism. The three emblems which concern us here present
the Herculean lover as a positive image rather than as an object of satire.
For example, on pages 32 and 33, Vaenius offers an emblem under the
astonishing motto “Virtutis Radix Amor” or “Love is the Cause of Virtue.''
Without love, he seems to suggest, the military man cannot achieve virtue at
all. In his illustration‚ Vaenius depicts a thoroughly heroic Hercules wearing
his lion’s skin and leaning on his club after killing the hydra (fig. 4). How-
ever, we also note a rather pained look on his face. Although the defeated
hydra lies vanquished between the hero's feet, Amor—on the left side of the
picture-is apparently the true victor over the hydra since he shot an arrow
into Hercules’ breast before the hero tackled the monster. Cupid conquers
the conqueror, who then gains sufficient strength from love’s arrow to sub-
due the monster with his club alone and without even cauterizing the hydra’s
multiple heads in accordance with details of the on'ginal myth. But, needless
to say, Vaenius is not really suggesting here that sensual love causes virtue
but rather that passionate spiritual or Platonic love inspires the hero with
sufficient strength to overcome his enemies.

The emblematist cites as the sources of his emblem both Plato and
Cicero, neither of whom would ever have argued on the side of sensuality.
Vaenius paraphrases Plato in the following Latin sentence: “Anima
immersa corpori, Amoris expergiscitur stimulis: 8c hinc primi ad honesta
impetus capiuntur'’ (Immersed in the body, the soul arouses itself by the
stings of Love; and from this the first beginnings of the virtues are taken).
According to Cicero, in another Latin paraphrase by Vaenius, “Sine studio
8c ardore quodam Amoris in vita nihil quidquam sit egregium'' (Without
a certain zeal and passion of love, nothing whatever would be admirable).
This statement derives from a speech of Crassus in De Oratore
