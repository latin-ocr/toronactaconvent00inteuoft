course and about the open-minded but perspicuous audience prepared to be
convinced‚ persuaded or moved. Being a simulation, the Cohortatio has in-
corporated all three: Ethoe, Logos, and Pathos into the text, which raised a
question as to its genre. Rhetorical production had been continuously sub-
jected to classification so as to isolate, compare and judge particular rhetori-
cal events or instances. Thus the various genres within the main classes of
discourse, verse, prose and drama were universally recognized and this facil-
itated both meta-textual discourse or treatises and renewed creativity, one of
whose manifestations was what 1 would like to call grafting.

In verse, for example, various types of persuasive speeches were grafted
onto the stock of epic poems (Homer); in prose, historical discourse was
enriched by the splicing in of real or imagined debates (Thucydides,
Herodotus). Grafting, however, was not limited to changing genres part
way along a narrative line: in tragedy‚ conflict among characters was
developed and resolved by passing it through a situational form proper to
a court of law and so subject to the rules of judicial rhetoric; dialectical
argumentation was frequently arranged in accordance with theatrical
rather than strictly logical modes, taking the form of dialogue. Since the
lyric love poem had entirely internalized participants in its discourse, that
is both poet and beloved, there was no external speaker or narrator to be
interrupted but as with tragedy‚ situations resembling those of any of the
oratorical genres were regularly exploited. The same may be said of
philosophical or political odes and epigrams in which speaker and audi-
ence, Etkos and Pathos were wholly fictionalized and incorporated into the
text. In every case, however, the original genre received the foreign
graftings without changing or appearing to change its identity.

The genre of the Renaissance text at hand, Cohortatio pamfimtmia, is
apparently that of a prose oration, upon which has been grafted elements
belonging to other, more literary‚ genres such as the dialogue and the
lyrical or philosophical poem with their fictionalized characters whose
individua! temperaments colour the arguments and influenoe the reader’s
intellectual and emotional reception of them. In this case, the reader may
substitute himself for the orator, the Ethos, as he reads, that is to say, as he
mouths the words, assuming the forceful, sincere, intelligent, persuasive
personality of the first-person speaker as well as his arguments. He does
not at this level position himself with Charles and Henri, who are given no
lines, who are silent receptors of the reader's harangue, but he talks to
them-persuasively. Another foreign element, proper to tragedy rather
than to oratory, is apparent in this text: the confrontation of protagonists
in an imagined situation: two powerful monarchs are, in the mind's eye of
the reader seated before an authoritative orator listening to the voice of
