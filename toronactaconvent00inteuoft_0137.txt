LAUREL CARRINGTON 1 19

Fantasies of a golden age are commonplaces of both Renaissance and
classical writers, although what is striking about this one is the extent to
which it focuses on language as the sign of an early state of health and the
symptom of subsequent decay. Another example of such a fantasy appears
in Cicero’s De Oratore, which mourns a similar loss of innocence, also
attributable to a corruption in the use of language. Here, Cicero holds
Socrates responsible for the decline:

hoc commune nomen en'puit, sapienterque sentiendi, et ornate dicendi
scientiam, re cohaerentis, disputationibus suis separavit. . . . Hinc
discidium illud exstitit quasi linguae atque cordis, absurdum sane et
inutile et reprehendendum, ut alii nos sapere, alii dicere docerent²²

In this passage, the sciences of language are not seen as evil; rather a
misuse of such science of right speaking, in detachment from right
thought and right action, is seen as dangerous. What is consistent is that
both Folly and Cicero's Crassus assert an ideal of integrity-between man
and man in community, or between heart and voice in speaking one’s
soul. Τὴε fall is a falling apart‚ a disintegration.

In Cicero’s complaint, metaphor occupies a curious position. First‚ in
looking especially at the case of Socrates, one can see that Socrates’
distrust of language in the Cratylus‚ his admonition to look for truth not
in words, but in things themselves‚²³ is analogous to his distrust of the
physical world and the senses that reveal it, and his secking of a truth
beyond the sensory. Metaphysics was born when Socrates took the step of
looking elsewhere for truth than in sensory reality, or when he separated
truth from appearance. A language fashioned to communicate things
about the sensory world would not do to explore the domain of truth, and
so metaphor in turn was born from metaphysics; resemblances were
exploited to fill in where literal language could not go, Language, express-
ing one meaning through its resemblance to another, became not the
communicator of meaning but the veil over meaning, that had to be lifted
in order to see the truth. In this scheme of things metaphor is not a
remedy so much as a stop-gap, which could cause mischief if the displace-
ment were to turn into a usurpation.

Cicero, even though he criticizes Socrates for bringing about this state
of affairs, still lives in a world where metaphor and literal speech are kept
