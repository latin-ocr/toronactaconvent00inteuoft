And, finally, what about the poetic possibilities of Christ's descent into
hell? Homer, Virgil, and other pagan poets told of heroic journeys into
the underworld. But what did their heroes accomplish in comparison with
Christ? Orpheus did not succeed in rescuing Eurydice. Odysseus and
Aeneas did nothing more except to chat with shadows. Hercules brought
back Cerberus. But what benefit did that monster give to the world? By
contrast, Christ redeemed mankind and rescued the souls of Old Testa-
ment heroes of saith like Adam, AbeLJob, David, and Moses. But, Mutius,
concludes:

Quid pergo molestus esse? Quid plura ingratis auribus ingero eorum
qui sanam doctrinam non sustinent? Iam carmina ipsa testentur an
possit Christus versibus celebrari. Vale.

It is interesting to see how Mutius's criticism of pagan poetry’s content
and his apology for the style of Christian poetry are translated into
practice in the De triumpho Christi itself. First of all, and most noticeably,
the author's strenuous objection to the content of pagan poetry seems to
lead to an extremely restricted use of pagan mythological characters. Even
though Mutius borrows heavily from Virgil's language, he refuses to give
any significant dramatic role to the traditional characters of classical
mythology. This is not to say that Mutius does not adopt some of the
terminology of Virgil’s underworld. Hell is Orcus or Tartarus; the Styx
river and the Cocytus still flow through Mutius’s underworld. He also
employs the standard personifications of nature found in classical mytho—
logy: Mutius's Dawn is, as one would expect, married to Tithonus and the
poet is not reluctant to refer to the sun as Titan.⁹ But the pagan mytho-
logical figures are present in name only in this Christian epic, relegated
for the great part to the realm of terminology.

This is clearly different from the practice of such nearly contemporary
poets asJacobus Bonus whose Sub figura Herculis Christi praeludium (1526)
treats of hell as a “classical-Dantesque landscape inhabited by classical
figures such as Pluto, Vulcan, Erebus, Medusa, Charon, Cerberus, Allecto,

⁹ Barbara Lewalski‚ Milton's Bries Epic: The Genre, Meaning, and An of Paradise
Regained ffrovidence, 1966), 57, overstates the case when she declares that the poem
“rejects all use of or allusion to pagan mythology.”
