MINNA SKAFTE JENSl-:N 59

Latin language and blackletter for Danish and German. There was a
feeling that certain alphabets suited certain languages, just as certain
messages came through better in one language than in another. All this
fitted into the overall world view that God had written his wisdom into the
Book of Nature in a special code, for the wise and patient reader to
decipher—as if written “in a glass, in a riddle‘’.²⁰ And the flood of classi-
cal authors in print must have added to the feeling that all knowledge was
already there; what was needed was careful reading and interpretation
rather than the breaking of new ground.

The interest in national history and in arcane writing systems combined
into a fascination with the runes. As yet, no serious research was being
done, but the runes were useful all the same as national monuments. In a
pastoral from 1560, Erasmus Laetus has a scene where a shepherd finds
and deciphers a runic inscription.²¹ The ancient model for the passage
is Calpurnius Siculus’ first eclogue where shepherds find a message from
the god Faunus written on the trunk of a tree. But whereas Calpurnius'
shepherds simply read their message, the Danish poet surrounds the event
with all kinds of solemn mystification: the shepherd has been abroad to
seek wisdom, only to learn that he must find it in his own native country;
he is guided in this pursuit by a prophetie bird, and before finally reading
the inscription he has to clear it of the symbolic moss with which less
pious ages have let it be overgrown.

In all this the general message was that Denmark was no barbarian
country. Even if Danes lived on the outskirts of the civilized world, they
had their part to play in the culture of Europe. The Latin language was
very important in this connection, not only for the rational reason that
you had to argue in Latin in order to be understood abroad, but also
because the language itself was the most important mark of civilization. It
is an overall implicit message in Danish Neo-Latin poetry, whatever its
explicit topic, that Denmark is part of the civilized world. The poetic
phrase for it is the international topos of inviting the Muses, and they are
duly invited to Denmark in poem after poem from the 1550’s onwards.²²

²⁰ l Ep.Cor. 13.12; the English translation “through a 31358, darkly‘’ is less precise
than both the Vulgate and Erasmus: “per speculum in aenigrnate.’'
