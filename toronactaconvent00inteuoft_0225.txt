regular school program, under the supervision of his “training master.’' As
he progresses sport by sport he carefully analyses each one forits benefits
and drawbacks, and subjects each to the scrutiny of the Galenic catagorieS.
Everyone knows a child is hot and moist in his physical complexion, but
if a child sits for long hours in study, his body will suffer. will the sport
sufficiently excite the natural heat of the body in order to overcome the
coldness brought on by too many hours in the classroom and the library?
Or will it too suddenly dry out the body that by its nature must retain a
great deal of this youthful moisture? Will the sport improve the appetite?
Or will it cause the student to feel unwell and to fall off his food? Every
aspect of the sportis considered in the light of the humoral balance of the
child or scholar practising it.

Now and then it is sometimes all too clear, from his limited enthusiasm
and information‚ that Mulcaster has never practised some of the sports he
describes. Furthermore, it is clear that although he speaks about a sport
within the context of schools and education, he has not a clue how to
bring that sport into the general curriculum of a school, certainly not into
the understaffed schools of Elizabethan England. Itis all quite theoretical.
And yet he is able to admit that he is describing a theoretical ideal, not a
standard for regular day-to-day practice. His reform is not to be absolute,
but to be set within the “circumstances” of the time, place, habits, and so
on of his fellow Englishmen (here he uses the word “circumstances'’ in a
more modern sense although it is related, via the Aristotelian categories,
to the “circumstances'' of rhetoric). By his application of “circumstances''
he tn’es to set his theoretical program within a contemporary context.

Nevertheless, despite this attention to circumstances, there seems
something remarkably bookish about Mulcaster's discussion of sports for
English schools. He talks about the English situation and tries to orient his
suggestions to the English scene, and yet most of his authorities are
