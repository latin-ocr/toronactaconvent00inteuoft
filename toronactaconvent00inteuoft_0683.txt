traditional “liberal'’ arts, conceived not as ends in themselves but as no
more than a set of preparatory studies necessasy to uphold the “splendid
estate of the nobility,’' as Vossius puts it (A ἐν’ 8, Ι.ἰ.1>-ἰη other words,
much the same elite as Milton envisions in OsEduoation. Although Milton's
phrase, “Next to make [the youngsters] expert in the usefullest points of
grammar” may at first seem redundant in light of his previous remarks
about the “necessary rules'’ of grammar and pronunciation (PW‚ 382-83),
his procedure here in fact runs exactly parallel to Vossius’s own return to
grammar (A &² S, 11, i.1-iii.l2)‚ a reiteration that becomes necessary if the
program is to enable students to turn from the Artes Populares to philologia
and enter into studies preparatory for the “liberal’' arts proper. Inasmuch
as Os Education later reveals that “the prosody of a verse” also belonged
among the “rudiments'' of grammar (PW‚ 403-4), it seems likely that, like
Vossius (A ἐν’ 8, n.ix.1-8), Milton thinks of grammar on this level as
encompassing Latin versification, not just vocabulary, forms, and syntax.
1 daresay that students would also be likely to encounter the tropes and
schemes of rhetoric under the same rubn'c, much as they are subsumed
under the more general heading of “philology” in Vossius (A ἕν’ S, 11.iv.1-
2; viii.1-9). As for Milton’s secking to buttress these tasks with “some easie
and delightfuu’‘ book of Education “withall to season thern and win them
early to the love of vertue and true labour'' (PW‚ 383-84), what is this but
taking Vossius's word philologia quite in its literal sense? In any event, it
comes as no surprise after consulting Vossius that Milton should thereup-
on proceed directly to the “rules of Arithmetick” and “soon after the
elements of Geometry’‘ (PW‚ 386). This is exactly what we find in the
Dutch Neo-Latin scheme too (A ἔθ’ S, 111.i.1-xiv.7), and it is perhaps worth
observing that with respect to mathematics, Milton does not appear to be
so original as some commentators insist (PW‚ 386-87, n. 82). Milton's next
step does depart sharply from Vossius, however. That is, he completely
passes logic by (cf. A &⁹ S, IV.i.l)—evidently a bugbear so truly detested
that he deliberately discards it—and proceeds instead to “easie grounds of
Religion and the story of Scripture'' (PW‚ 387). Hereby, of course, he
begins to lay the groundwork for later study on Vossius‘s fifth level;
namely‚ theology or doctrina inspiratasmvelata, as sons of the Reformed
church like Vossius and Milton would indeed tend to term it (A ἀν’ S,
Vxxiii).

The last step in the Latin curriculum is designed to give students their
first sample of level four, the level Vossius calls true “philosophy‘’ (A &S‚
V.i.1), the final end at which the entire course of preparatory studies has
been aimed. This is exactly what happens in Milton's Latin strand too.
However, in Milton this phase consists of no more than an initiation into
