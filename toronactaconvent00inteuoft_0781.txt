Erasmus and Aurelius
and Their Lives ofJerome:
A Study of Coeperation and Dependence*

KARIN TILMANS

l n one of the first rooms of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam we find a
small early—sixteenth-century painted panel titled: “Spes Nostra'’ (figure
1). The name of the painter is unknown, so heis referred to as the Master
of the “Spes Nostra.'’ The words “Spes Nostra'’ refer to the· pregnant girl
sitting in the background; they stem from the well-known medieval hymn
“Salve Regina.'‘ In this song Man‘a is called mankind's hope, she is show-
ing her child at the hour of death. But it is not so much Maria nor Eliza-
beth, seen touching her belly, that intrigues us most in this beautiful
painting. As becomes obvious from other figures, the panel was ordered
by the religious congregation with which the three main characters of this
paper had a special relationship. The painting was apparently commis-
sioned by the Dutch Congregation of Sion. This congregation consisted of
a group of Dutch monasteries of Augustinian canons and brothers, with
Saint Jerome as their patron. It was in this order that both Erasmus and
Aurelius took vows before 1490. In the foreground we see the Church
Fathers Jerome (left) and Augustine (right) and four impressive regular
canons in white dress and with a black eope. This was the normal dress of
Erasmus before 1513, when he decided to put aside his monk’s habit. His
friend, the poetry teacher Cornelius Aurelius, who was nine years older

than he, went into the monastery after 1485 and did wear the Augustinian
frock until his death in 1531}
