744 CHRISTIAN EPIC THEORY AND PRACTICE

Centaurs''¹⁰ and other creatures, or Jacopo Sannazaro’s (1456-1530) De
partu virginis in which we find Jesus' feet being kissed by Neptune as he
walks across the Sea of Galilee. Even the fairly conservative Mantuan
(1447-1516) finds no incongruity in allowing Thetis, Ceres, and Aeolus to
pay homage to the Virgin Mary in the first Panhenice.¹¹ The closest paral-
lel to Mutius's practice in this regard is Marcus Hieronymus Vida (bishop
of Alba from 1533-1566) who also uses only Christian supernatural agents
in his Christiad, but at the same time retains the “classical atmosphere and
furniture of Hell-Avernus.'’¹²

In the second place, as Mutius’s extreme defensiveness on this score in
the second preface would indicate, he is aware of the stylistic problems
involved in transforming biblical narrative into hexameters. One major
structural problem facing the biblical poet was how to tell a story (like the
life of Christ) which is panoramic in scope while maintaining some kind of
unity. Mutius solves the problem deftly. His poem achieves the same kind
of annalistic effect which biblical poets as early asJuvencus (a contempo-
rary of Constantine) had tried to achieve. Mutius compiles a long cata-
logue of Old Testament heroes and heroines, beginning with Adam and
continuing all the way down to the innocents slain by the soldiers of
Herod. His poem, short as it is, therefore, reaches back to the creation of
man. It also extends forward to the last judgement. In the final lines of the
poem, Mutius tells of Christ’s ascension into heaven, accompanied by the
souls of the Old Testament believers and prays that he too will fmd a
place there on the last day.

Unlike such traditional biblical poets asJuvencus and Mantuan‚ howev-
er, Mutius does not begin his epyllion ab ovo. Instead he treats of a strictly
limited subject, the events of one day, the day on which Christ descended
into the underworld. The actual focus of this poem is restricted to the
descent into hell. Old Testament characters are introduced only because
these are the souls whom Christ has come to the underworld to rescue.
This concern with observing the unities of time and place, of course, has
more affinities with the classical aesthetic than with the biblica1.¹³ Again

¹³ It is also worth noting‚ incidentally, that Mutius chooses to concentrate on a
martial subject, a topic especially well suited for epic, according to Horace (“res gestae
regumque ducumque et tristia bella''), thus avoiding a charge that was frequently
made against other biblical poetry, namely, that its peaceful subject was not suited for
the epic genre (cf. Lewalski, 72).
