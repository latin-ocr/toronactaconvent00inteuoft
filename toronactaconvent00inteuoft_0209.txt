MARIANNE Ati-:mus 185

are known for having established a library and for the founding of a home
for unmarried ladies of rank where eight women at a time could live and
study. Men could visit the library as guests, a privilege which was utilized
by Albert Thura, among others, when he was writing his Gynaeceum.

Bircherod’s group five contained poets, i.e., poets who did not attain to
the level of the Norwegian Dorothea Engelbretsdatter. This group had five
members. Of the remaining seven women, he allows four to assume a
place among the learned, among these Birgitte Thott. And of his own
accord he adds two that were not found in Matthias Schacht’s list: Leo-
nora Christine Ulfeldt and Man'e Below.

According to Bircherod, it was the case that all six of these could be
shown to have knowledge of Latin. In compaiison we can mention that
the German Paullinus, in his gynaeceum from 1695‚¹⁵ divides his women
into very learned and less learned, “hoch-gelahrte und wohl-gelahrte.” All
four of his very learned women knew Latin.

A reply in Lan‘n from Otto Sperling to Jens Bircherod has been pre·
served. The former wn'tes:

As to that which you point out concerning our learned women, it is
indeed completely true that they have not been in contact with all
forms of learning, but that some are more learned than others. But
even those whom you consider to be learned: Below, Thott, Quit-
zow, Bredal, and Engelbrecht are in fact not learned beyond Latin.
For 1 cannot see that they have done anything about Greek and
Hebrew, and in this way there are at least some aspects of learning
they apparently have not acquired.¹⁶

Thus, Sperling recognizes the fact that “their’' women are not qualified to
receive the title of learned from a formalistic point of view. On the other
hand, he continues:

But we can also establish learning solely within the Danish language,
or within one foreign language or another; to the extent that it is

omnes solidae eruditionis attigisse, sed alias aliis doctiores fuisse. Nam et illae, quas tu
doctas censuisti, Beloviam, Tottiam, Qvitzoviam‚ Bredalinam, Engelbrechtiam, non
ultra latinam lingvam doctae fuerunt3 Graeoe enim et Hebraea nec illas video attigisse,

Library in Copenhagen, MS. Ny kgl. Saml. 1986c, vol. 41 in quarto). Date of the letter,
