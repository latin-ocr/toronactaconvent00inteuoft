our humanist, have also contributed much to the study at hand. However,
no in-depth study of the surviving collection has ever been conducted, no
list of de Pins’ literary correspondents has been presented.

It is not surprising that the Graverol manuscript has long gone unno-
ticed. The General Catalogue of the Municipal Library of Nimes mentions
only our author's name, the date Graverol had completed his transcription
(4⁶ Id. Mart. 1691) and the dimensions of the volume. No mention ap-
pears of the dates or the persons to whom the letters were sent.¹³ It is
for this reason, most probably, that the collection has gone unnoticed in
the latest volume of Kristeller’s Iter Italimm,¹⁴ a painstaking survey of hu-
manist manuscripts in and outside of Italy. As we await the final tran—
scription and edition of the Graverol codex, it seems appropriate that
researchers be reminded of the existence of this Latin correspondence,
and more important, that they gain a more detailed knowledge of its
contents.

Although Graverol’s copy is an incomplete transcription of the original
manuscript, he was nonetheless a meticulous scholar. In miscellaneous
notes at the end of his transcription‚ Graverol provides a brief description
of the on'ginal collection which is now missing. As he states there, the
original collection had belonged to the inheritors of a certain Bernard
Medon, identified as a former councillor of the seneschal of Toulouse. It
had contained 118 letters of Jean de Pins' correspondence, of which
Graverol claims to have copied only the first 53 in their entirety.¹⁵ This
statement is reinforced in a separate marginal note at the end of lettre no.
