492 APPEAL FOR THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN

mastered Latin, but went on to acquire the tongues for Scripture studies,
Greek and HebreW, Syriac, and Chaldee. To gain access to the texts of the
Coptic church, she compiled a grammar of Ethiopic.

Talented she was in many ways. She engraved pictorial designs by
diamond on glass, and worked in tapestry: some of her creations are
museum treasures to this day. Her portrait drawings and her etchings
brought her into the company of the professional artists, Meerevelt,
Lievens, and the Honthorsts.³ She soon became widely known for learned
discourses on philosophical questions in letters she exchanged in Latin
and Greek with Dutch savants, with sympathetic correspondents in Eng-
land, with the French polymaths Salmasius, Mersenne, Gassendi, and
Descartes.

In the Netherlands she became a national celebrity. Latin verses were
composed to sing her praises, composed by Jacob Cats‚ Daniel Heinsius,
Constantine Huygens, Caspar Barlaeus, and many others. In turn she won
recognition for her own Latin poems returning the compliment to these
men and other versifiers?¹

When the burghers of her city, prospering in the third generation of
Dutch independence‚ launched a new university at Utrecht in 1636, the
incoming rector Gisbert Voetius turned to Anna Maria van Schurman to
contribute the customary Latin ode required for the inaugural ceremo-
nies. She composed the kind of ode that was wanted, replete with the
sentiments and allusions appropriate to such an occasion, framing begin-
ning and end with the traditional emblems of Utrecht, opening with the

Electio. Tractatus Vitae ejus Delineationem exhibens. Altonae ad Albim, Ex Officina Cornelii
van der Meulen, 1673.

⁴ Much of her correspondence is printed in her opuscula and the Beverovicius

survive at the museums above and the British Library‚ Harleian MS. 6824. Verses from
