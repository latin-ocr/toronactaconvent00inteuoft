518 PRINTED COMMONPLACE BOOKS

in which the places were arranged, sometimes following alphabetical
convention‚ but sometimes complex patterns of subordinates and contrar-
ies, which reveal deep-seated notions of how things connect and which
things are mutually opposed. Yet it is of the nature of the commonplace
book that the quotations it gathers tend to pull away from the norms to
which they are attached. The very function of the places as ever-expanding
receptacles of multiple quotations is to add, not foreclose, to produce
linguistic variations more admired for their inventiveness than for their
referentiality‚ perhaps to invite sels-contradiction and the scepticism that
may go with it. By the end of the sixteenth century commonplace books
could go to extremes. At one end there was the carefully supervised and
censored selection operated in Jesuit schools; at the other, collections of
political aphorisms from very diverse sources proposed in a positivist spirit
as issues of contemporary debate.¹⁴ Like Montaigne (and both were
learned humanists, both actively involved in political life), Francis Bacon
had a very ambivalent attitude to the commonplace book, but he too
recognised its potential for discovery:

Aphorisms, since they lay before us only certain portions and, as it
were, bits and pieces of knowledge, invite others to add and contrib-
ute something in their turn.¹⁵
