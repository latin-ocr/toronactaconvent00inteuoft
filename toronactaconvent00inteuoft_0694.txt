668 MARc-ANTOINE MURET

letters, he says “titillatione quadam honestissimae voluptatis alliciunt'’ and
this leads to moral improvement, preserving the reader from unacceptable
pleasure, and he adds, “Nimirum ut major lux minorem, ita minoris
voluptatis sensum perceptio majoris extinguit” (16). Yet he has admitted
that literature is pleasurable, and that sensibility matters.

The second speech develops the relationship between imaginative
literature and moral teaching, and states the intellectual value of literary
training, for understanding the philosophical content of poetic rables:
“sub eis, velut involucris, atque integumentis, omnis doctrina elegans,
omnis ingenuo homine digna cognitio, omnis denique sapientia contine-
tur” (26). The teacher must be eloquent, because of the persuasive power
of literature in the controlling of emotions, and because he prepares
young men who will guide the people; he must also aim at encyclopedic
learning. Arts like physics, medicine, and civil law are sels-contained,
literature alone embraces everything: “Nos uni summ, quibus omnis illa
liberalium artium varietas non pertractanda quidem, ac pernoscenda
penitus, sed degustanda tamen, et delibanda necessario est'' (28). As he
tells us himself, he put his own legal training to good use when he taught
the Verrine Orations, and will draw on his knowledge of philosophy when
he comments on the De Finibus. “Quid astrorum ratio? Quid terrarum
situs?’' he concludes, and asks, “Nisi qui haec utraque utcunque teneat,
satisne se quisquam idoneum poetarum interpretem profiteri potest?’'
(29). Once more it is clear that he is trying to establish a new status for
men of his profession.⁵

The third speech, on the joining of philosophy and eloquence‚ works
out in some detail this other Renaissance commonplace, which sums up
the Renaissance ideal of education, that sound learning and good powers
of communication together form the true humanist. Once more Muret is
attempting to define the role of the teacher of literature. His colleagues
restrict themselves to explaining speeches and poems, to the neglect of

various prefaces and dedications of Lambin to which he refers3 cf. also my articles
“Peter Ramus and the reform of the university: the divorce of philosophy and
eloquence?” in Frenck Renaissance studies. Humanism and the Encyclopedia (1540-15 70),
ed. Peter Sharratt (Edinburghz Edinburgh Univ. Press, 1976), and “The role of the
writer and the uses of literature. Critical theory in the prefaces to the editions of the
classics in sixteenth-century France’‘ in Acta Conventus Neo-latini Turonensis (Parisz Vrin,
1980), 1249-56. Bacon, it may be noted, in the preface to the Great Instauration,
observes that knowledge should not be sought for pleasure of the mind, nor for lesser
selfish reasons, but for “the benefit and use of life.’‘

⁵ Erasmus, too, insists that the teacher of literature must aim at omniscienoe, cf.
De ratione studii ac legendi interpretandique auctores in Collected Works os Erasmus, ed.
Brian McGregor, vol. 24 (Torontot Toronto Univ. Press, 1978), 672-75.
