488 ΤΗΕ LITURGICAL CONTEXT OF ERASMUS'S HYMNS

to form three sections commonly found in hymns and sequences: the first
three quatrains invoke the earthly choir and join to it the angels, virgins,
martyrs‚ and saints in heaven; the next three praise Mary by means of ana·
logies with stars‚ flowers, and trees, especially (of course) the laurel; the
last extended quatrain asks Mary for help. Each of the three sections be-
gins with an especially long couplet and ends with an especially short one.

Surely Erasmus's sequence is an amazing synthesis of techniques drawn
from classicism, humanism, and the Middle Ages, early and late.

I hope that examining these four hymns in their liturgical context has
suggested how selective they are in content and how skillful and varied
they are in technique.
