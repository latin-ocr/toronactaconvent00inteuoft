Historiography and Humanism

in Early Sixteenth-century Scandinavia

KARSTEN FRIIS-JENSEN

At the beginning of the sixteenth century many states of northern
Europe saw it as a necessity to produce a history of their own

country in polished Latin, intended first of all for a public abroad. Italian
humanist historiography of the fifteenth century set the standard, on
several levels. The strong chauvinism of Italian humanists, claiming Italy
to be the true and only heir to the classical tradition and thus to civiliza-
tion in general, was in itself a challenge. The primary aim for the new
writers of pattiotic history was to show that their country also represented
old and important cultural traditions, if possible with links to the classical
world. Τὴε Italian insistence on a polished classicizing Latin as the only
acceptable medium for such historical works was met with more whole-
hearted approval‚ in principle at least.

The French humanist Robert Gaguin published a history of France in
Latin in 1495. An Italian humanist, Paulo Emilio, was commissioned by
the French king to write a more official work. The first part of his history
of France was printed in 1517 by a man who will be mentioned several
times in this paper‚ the Patisian printer and humanist Jodocus Badius
Ascensius. Emilio's work was clearly a stylistic improvement compared
with Gaguin's. In England another Italian, Polydore Vergil, wrote the
official work of history, published in 1534. In Germany, native humanists
were at work. The circle around Emperor Maximilian concentrated mainly
on the history of the Holy Roman empire‚ and of that part of Germany
which had been Roman, whereas northern Germany found its historiogra-
pher in the Hamburg diplomat Albert Krantz.¹ Scandinavian humanists
