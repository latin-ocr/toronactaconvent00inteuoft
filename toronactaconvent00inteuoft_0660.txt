636 BARTHOLOMAEUS COLONIENSIS: Two FABLES

The second fable bears the title De corvo et vulpe, accompanied by its
traditional moral “ne fidem adhibeamus adulatorum blanditiis.'' The poet,
however, takes even fewer pains to conform to his model: the customary
piece of cheese is no more mentioned than in the first fable and the raven
is not even flattered on account of its good voice. On the contrary, the
poet speaks of “garrula murmura'’ (line 6) and makes the fox speak
directly to the raven of “clamosas voces” (line 13) and “nimia garrulitate''
(line 14), of “obtundere'' (line 15) and “vocibus horrendis'’ (line 16).
Then, after a verbal contest that brings to mind a coloratura-opera in
which two singers try to outdo each other by the briliance and virtuosity
of their an'as, the fable reaches the stupendous conclusion already men-
tioned: the raven, traditionally the victim of its own vanity and the flatter-
ies of the fox, does not comply with the request of the fox and so evades
a certain death. This ending, alien to the Fabula de corvo et vulpe, has a
parallel: oddly enough, this parallel is the fable in the Romulus-collection,
entitled De gallo et vulpe.

Apart from these obvious differences in content between Bartholo-
maeus's fables and the conventional representatives of the genre, there is
another disparity that at first is even more striking. Compared to “nor-
mal’' fables, these two are very long; and, what is more, their inordinate
length is filled by a completely different vocabulary and phraseology. The
conventional classical fable is tersely and sometimes rather boringly
worded. This obtains even more forits post-classical successors. In Bartho-
lomaeus's fables, however, there is never a dull moment. Within the scope
of this paper these poems cannot be discussed in detail, but a few passag-
es can be shortly described.

In the first fable, the opening speech of the fox (lines 5-12) consists of
eight verses full of poetical commonplaces; however, looking back on it
after having read the whole of the two fables, it is comparatively modest.
But the cock immediately almost buries it under seventeen lines of mytho-
logical erudition: there is the story of the dying swan, of Phaethon who
fell into the river Po when trying to drive the chariot of the Sun; there are
Orpheus, the monster Argos guarding Io, the Sirens, Arion and his
dolphin, and finally “nigra Persephone‘’ and the Phlegeton.

Another example can be found from line eighty onwards in the second
fable. In the preceding lines the fox has explained the situation: he is ill
and to embrace the raven will cure him. For this the fox has promised the
raven immortal fame. The raven's answer (lines 80-89) is negative: he
compares the flattering words of the fox to innocent-looking animals like
scorpions and bees, with their hidden sting, and to the melodious but fatal
sound of the fowler’s flute. The fox, pretending to be indignant, answers
