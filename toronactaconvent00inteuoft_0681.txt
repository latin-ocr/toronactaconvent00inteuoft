ly antedates Vossius‘s treatise, the seventeenth-century hierarchy of arts
and sciences that the Dutch scholar recorded is nonetheless useful in
arriving at some of the key thought behind the kinds and order of studies
that turn up in Milton.

Let us begin by consulting the digest of Vossius‘s “Distn‘buu'on of the
Arts and Sciences” that is appended to this essay.⁶ The first point to note
is an essential‚ if obvious difference between Milton and Vossius. That is,
the moment one glances at Vossius’s scheme, it becomes immediately
apparent why Milton’s “curriculum'’ fails initia] expectations of twentieth-
century readers looking for an orderly sequence of educational “units.’'⁷
OfEducation does not take student experience as its organizing principle,
presents no simple linear progression from the lowest level of study up a
single ladder to the highest in unbroken sequence. On the contrary, if
viewed from a student's perspective, it seems to suffer from an odd
incoherence that we rather too quickly ascribe to haste or informal,
perhaps overly compact epistolary style. That is, Milton's outline of
subjects proceeds unevenly, incorporating seeming redundancies and
repetitions, as if within such a short and sels-consciously condensed essay
it were possible for him to suffer uncharacteristic lapses in attention, at
times forgetful of what he says about grammar even from one sentence to
the next, acting unsure of when a language like Italian should be taken up,
or neglecting to present information on a matter like versification at the
proper time and then having to double back to insert it later (e.g., PW‚
382-83, 369, 404). But if we read Milton’s program in light of the distribu-
tion adopted in Vossius’s treatise, it soon becomes apparent that the
“curriculum'’ in OsEducation consists of at least three separate strands‚ all
proceeding parallel to each other up through a taxonomy that, despite
Milton’s occasional concessions to exigencies of practica} pedagogy, looks
nevertheless very much like Vossius's five-sold system. It is the assumed
