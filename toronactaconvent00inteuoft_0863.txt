PETER ZEEBERG 837

“Thus’' he says “one love can become a remedy against another love,” and
then he adds, with an ingenious rewriting of Virgil's “omnia vincit Amor,’'
that the love that conquers everything should also conquer itself:

Deniqve qvicqvid erit, leviter qvod nectit amorem,
Et gravis et melior fac cito pellat amor.
Sic amor alterius fiet medicamen amoris
Omnia qui vincit, se quoque vincat amor.
(vv. 35-38)

Now, this love for science may be found at Uraniborg‚ where Erik can
devote himself to the arts (and again the three arts from above are repeat-
ed, in fact they serve as a “leitmotif’ throughout the poem). This may be
accomplished with the help of Tycho’s love for him.

What we have here is clearly a remodelling of the theme we met in the
first two poems: The choise of science as opposed to the perishable
earthly life. But this time it is described in terms of earthly versus heavenly
love. The latter, which is described as a gift from the gods,¹⁰ is more true,
and greater than the first, which is in its turn depicted as very small.
Because of his size he can't reach to the stars or penetrate into the bowels
of the earth. This “pusillus amor” gets lost in trifles, “perit in minimis.”
(As you see, some words still refer to the language of elegiae love.)

It would be natural to see this as a reflection of the neo-platonic
philosophy of love, which goes back to Marsilio Ficino, but became
fashionable through the works of Pietro Bembo and especially through
Castiglione's dialogue about “The Courtier’‘: Love as the moving force
behind the ascension of the soul towards the divine. love, that is, as the
force behind exactly that movement which Tycho in the elegy to Urania
used to describe his scientific urge. And in fact we have passages in other
poems where the term of love is used explicitly in this connection.¹¹

This also gives us a clue to an understanding of the last distich of our
love poem, the epilogue. “If you don't want the true love,” he says, “take

¹⁰ Verior et major typis tua pedara nostris
Musa omnes superos ome ut imm amor. (vv. 69-70)

The mentioning of printing (typis . . . nostris) is due to the fact that this poem was the
very first text to be printed at the new printing works—a fact which also inspires Tycho
to a whole series of puns on the word premere.

¹¹ Eg„ Opem omnia 2:302 (the Paraeneticum) and 6:340 (a poem for Landgraf
wilhelm of Hesse). A poem in the introductory letters in De nova stella (Opem omnia
1:69) has: “hoec est ea Diva voluptas s Quae similes celsis nos facit asse deis.”
