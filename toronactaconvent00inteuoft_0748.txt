722 DANISH NEO-LATIN EPIC

Seven Years War between Denmark and Sweden had just ended, more or
less indecisively. Margaretica deals with a great Danish victory over Sweden
some 200 years earlier, in 1389, but the poem nevertheless contains a
large number of allusions to the recent Seven Years War—which therefore,
indirectly‚ is made to look like a great Danish victory.

It is not just any previous Danish victory over Sweden Laetus has
chosen as his subject matter. The poem deals with the victory of the ruling
Danish Queen Margaret over the Swedish King Albrecht (Laetus has
appropriately dedicated the poem to a contemporary ruling queen,
Elizabeth of England). This victory paved the way for the so-called Union
of Kalmar between Denmark and Sweden which lasted until 1523, under
the rule of Danish kings. Once the union was dissolved, the Swedish kings
were at pains to distance themselves from this previous dependence; so
when Laetus chose precisely this battle as the subject of his epic, it was
clearly intended as a provocation.

In one of the central scenes Queen Margaret lies awake at night in fear
of the numerous threats of war which had been given by the Swedish king.
The scene has models in the Aeneid where Aeneas often lies awake with
the gnawing uncertainty as to where he is going to lead the Trojans. Like
Aeneas, Margaret receives the answer in a dream. This answer, given by
her deceased husband, is a description of the glorious Danish kings who
are to reign over the Union of Kalmar—that is if she now responds to the
challenges of the Swedish king by going to war. This prophecy is modelled
upon Anchises’ foretelling to Aeneas of the future greatness of Rome in
the sixth book of the Aeneid. Thereby the union between Denmark and
Sweden is made to form a counterpart to Rome in the prophecy of
Anchises, a suggestion that must have been highly provocative to Swedes
at the time.

Virgil's Aeneid is in fact the most important literary model for Marga-
retica. Among other things, Laetus has borrowed a number of features
from the description of the Trojan war, in the second book of the Aeneid,
for his portrayal of the battle itself—Sweden of course playing the part of
the defeated Troy.

In addition, the figure of Queen Margaret has much in common with
Aeneas, but unlike Aeneas she shows practically no signs of human weak-
ness. She is a perfect monarch, while her opponent, the Swedish King
Albrecht, is a tyrant pure and simple.

Albrecht’s intention with the war is to conquer the Scanian provinces
(today the southernmost area of Sweden which was part of Denmark until
1658). With this Laetus is clearly alluding to the Swedish king during the
recent Seven Years War, Erik 14, who had declared, correspondingly, that
his highest goal was to make the Scanian provinces Swedish. However,
