Phaedrus, and Laws as representative of instructive argument.

Whereas expositio represents a means to exhort or advise through use of
discussion, inquisitio reflects a use of the Socratic method which leads to
match-winning or truth-hunting. Sigonius defines two sorts of dialogue
that belong to this later classiflcation: (1) obstetricus, or the maie-utic, or
art-of-the-midwife‚ dialogue; (2) tentativus, or peimstic, debates that Aristot-
le had termed as examination—arguments. In describing the maieutic, or
midwife sort, Sigonius relies upon Plato's definition of the Socratic
method in Theaetetus (150b-15la). Similar to the midwife sterile in body,
Socrates is lacking in wisdom and, through a series of questionS‚ draws
forth knowledge. Unlike the interlocutor in the expositiO, Socrates does not
propose any statement. Rather, through the use of inquiry, he enables his
respondents to advance from ignorance and misconcepu‘ons to a discovery
of “many fair things” within themselves. Thus, Socrates does not instruct;
and, by employing a negative approach that dn'ves the respondent to
sels-contradiction or to a concession of ignorance, he enables the interloc-
utor to recognize his confused conception and ignorant thoughts. Sigonius
provides two reasons for Socrates's use of maieutic approach: refutation of
sophistic learning, training of minds in a method resulu‘ng in valid opinions
The use of elenchus compels the respondent to deny a position and, for
Plato, represents a method that trains minds in the art of argumentation.
Sigonius, though, sees a greater application of this approach, for such
inquiry, he notes, restores an understanding of knowledge.

Although Sigonius views the tentativus, or examination—argument, as a
form of inquiry, this sort of dialogue also shares characteristics of expositio.
In describing this type of discourse, Sigonius relies upon a speech by
Hippias in Plato's Protagoras (337e-338a). A discussion of topics that may
lead to wisdom requires seriousness of purpose and dignity of speech.
Socrates, Hippias says, should not confine his words to extreme brevity‚
and Protagoras should avoid excessive eloquence. Hippias does not
prescribe the techniques of such a middle course. But Sigonius continues
to see the value of numerous sharp questions which, characteristic of
maieutic debate‚ serve as an effective instrument in combating sophistry.
The maieutic method‚ though, could also be employed in contentious or
sophistical contests. In countering such misapplication, Sigonius emphasiz-
es the didactic purpose of dialogue; and he contends that, through the
inclusion of demonstrative discourse characteristic of expositio, the practi-
tioner of examination-arguments assists the reader in his search for truth.

Form accompanies substance. With Sigonius’s stress upon the poetic
and rhetorical characteristics of dialogue, his comments on the style of
dialogue reinforce the artistic aspects of the genre. Dialogues consist of
