632 BARTHOLOMAEUS COLONIENSIS: Two FABLES

His extant works are: In prose an Epistula mythologica (Deventer: J. de
Breda 1489s90) which was called by a German editor of the last century
“eine Humoreske aus der Zeit des deutschen Friihhumanismus.'’³ In 1500
he published a book entitled Canones cum declarationibus eorundem in
tabulas computi ecclesiastici (Zwolle: P. Os), which in later editions appeared
with an additional Libellus de magnitudine terrae, lunae et solis, and in 1515
appeared a Tractatus de diversis rebus ponderabilibus (Deventer: T. de
Borne). There is also a Libellus isagogicus seu introductorius in primum,
secundum et tertium tractatus Petri Hispani and a “Letter to Pancratius.''⁴

His poetical work consists of a collection of various poems that is called
Silva Car-minum (Deventer: J. de Breda, 1491), an eclogue (or, as the
manuscript calls it, egloga bucolici carminis)⁵ and a Libellus elegiaeus de
septenis doloribus Mariae, published in the year 1514 (Deventer: J. de
Breda). Three other poems have come down to us that are connected with
his Alkmaar years: one of them is entitled De miraculoso sanguine civitatis
Alcmariensis carmen heroicum, celebrating a Holy Blood-miracle that took
place in Alkmaar in 1429 and was commemorated annually.⁶ The second
poem, Carmen de Sancto Matthia, is written in elegiae distichs and ad-
dressed to the tutelary saint of Alkmaar's principal church. The last poem,
in acslepiadei minores, is in praise of St. Lawrence‚ patron of the city.⁷
Bartholomaeus also wrote several commendatory poems for other books.

The two fables that are my particular object in this paper can be found
at the end of the Silva Carminum. They are both written in elegiae distichs;
the first consists of seventy, the second of 144 lines.

The fable-literature of elassical antiquity was, for its Greek part, written
in prose (Aesopus) and choliambs (Babn‘us); in Latin, Phaedrus, using
Aesopus as his main source, wrote iambic senan'i and Avianus, drawing prin-
cipally on Babrius, used the elegiae distich. Its contents are tersely phrased
