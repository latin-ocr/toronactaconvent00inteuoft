up by the outgoing tide and frequently ssoat in the sea. It is indeed
unlikely that Salvia grows on the Caspian shores which on all sides are
sandy and wild. 1 have heard no reports nor have I ever seen any plants
while traveling through that region. I have encountered a certain species
of it on a few and more fertile plains adjacent to the Volga, but some
hundreds of leagues from the Caspian. Any removal of the leaves from
there will prove useless, for in the vast stretch of river, sea and subterra·
nean passage they will be battered by the water, will decompose and settle
to the bottom. 1 add that if the Caspian Sea emptied itself by these
whirlpools, of necessity the huge swirls of water both gliding out from the
Caspian and belching forth in the Persian Gulf would reveal themselves
with a prodigious tumult. Neither I, while sailing on the Caspian, nor
others, as far as 1 have learned by inquiry, have ever seen any.

Where then, you will ask, does the horrendous mass of water which
ssows in remain if it is not absorbed by the aforementioned whirlpools?
The Volga or the Rha river alone, which unburdens itself with eighty
mouths, replenishes its waters over the course of five hundred and more
miles from the west and the first territories of Russia. Between the met-
ropolises of Shemakha in Shirvan and Rasht in Hyrcania, a distance of
nearly sixty miles, 1 counted more than fifty swollen and rapid n'vers,
omitting the streams‚ flowing into the Caspian. The most famous among
these, the Kura, after which Cyrus is named, equals our Elbe in size and
exceeds it in velocity, in as much as it ultimately absorbs the Aras which
draws the waters of almost all Armenia. What of the huge Ural n'ver from
the north beyond the sources of the Ob, the Syr Darya from Turkestan
and deserts of Eastern Tartaria‚ the Oxus from India near the Himalaya
Mountains, the begettor of the Ganges—all of which rivers deposit springs,
rains, and melted snows into this guardian of the water of Asia? Perhaps
we will not stray from the truth, if with the most ancient authors, we
attribute to our sea a union with the ocean, or to put the matter more
clearly, if we assert that through a subterranean abyss the Caspian comes
together and forms a continuum with the ocean. Indeed, just as the ocean
in many locations (as has been explored by taking soundings) extends
downward to an immense depth, so it is likely that the same ocean also
enters caves and openings running horizontally and obliquely. Tbese
connect both with certain inland lakes, those to be sure whose waters,
increased by a perennial influx, imperceptibly recede, and with certain
extraordinary pools and spn'ngs whose liquids are said to resemble the
tides of the ocean by increasing and decreasing. Philosophers will never
explain such phenomena short of this hypothesis of continuity. If so, we
are no longer astonished that even if the Caspian Sea experienced a
