reader (as for instance Turnus in the Aeneid). Throughout, the centra! and
unmisunderstandable message is that Sweden deserved to lose and Den-
mark to win.

To sum up: 1 have tried to point out how classsical historica} epic is
transformed into national polemics. In the poems of Laetus and Borch‚
the divine messages in the dreams are modelled upon centra! prophecies
in the Aeneid. Thereby the subject of the poem is placed in a wider
perspectjve of national history; but this perspective is, in these two poems,
simply an enumeration of Swedish shortcomings and Danish successes.
Similarly, in Harder's poem, another epic device, the involvement of
supernatura] powers, contributes towards associating the opponent parts,
Danes and Swedes, with Good and Evil, respectively. Finally Harder’s use
of Claudian is perhaps worth noticing. In Claudian's straightforward
propagandistic poetry, court poets of later ages must have found a more
readily adaptible model than in the subtle narrative of Virgil's Aeneid.
