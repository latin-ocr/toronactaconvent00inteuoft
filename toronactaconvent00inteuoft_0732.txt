706 THE EMBLEMS OF CRANACH AND VAENIUS

(Ιαωεὶν.134-ΧΧΧ).12 The English verse by Verstegan, which also accompa-
nies the emblem, explains that,

Moste great and woorthie deeds had neuer bin atchyved,
If in respect of loue they had not bin begunne,

Loues victorie hath made more victories bee wonne,
From loue-bred virtue then thus were they first deryued.

It would seem, therefore, that Vaenius’s love god is not wanton Eros at all
but Plato’s second love called Anteros, or the spiritual love of the cardinal
virtuestjustice, Fortitude, Temperance, and Wisdom.

In fact, Anteros, the mythical younger brother of Eros, is depicted
elsewhere (fig. 5) in Emblemes osLove in the act of chastizing Eros for his
sensual excesses (pp. 68-69).¹³ This second love god is therefore a fit
companion for virtuous Hercules and vice versa. Because Anteros inspires
mankind to true love, which includes acts of charity and martyrdom, he
also teaches the Herculean lover that love is as heroic a venture for
mankind as is military heroism on the battlefield. Although Alciati first
introduced the opposing figures of Eros and Anteros into emblem litera-
ture in 1531, the mythographer Vincenzo Cartari finally tells the full story
of their competition in the 1556 edition of his Le imagini de i dei de gli
antichi and in the later illustrated edition of 1571.¹⁴ Cartari also associ-
ates Hercules with Anteros in an interesting context. He describes a
Roman statue of Amor standing between the figures of Mercury and
Hercules; this juxtaposition means, he says, that Love is both reasonable
and virtuous.¹⁵ Like most humanist painters, Vaenius undoubtedly knew
Cartari's book, which influenced his view of Hercules and Amor.

Vaenius next provides an emblem of Hercules in full battle array. The
hero is shown holding Amor firmly by the hand while leading him up the
steep and narrow path to fame (fig. 6). Hercules looks down at Cupid in
a kindly and paternal fashion, while the little love god gazes up at his
guide with an attitude of worshipful admiration (pp. 53-54). Here the
topos of the “Choice of Hercules'' has been cleverly conflated by Vaenius

by Ausonius, who was inspired by a wall-painting of Zoilus. See Vol. Ι, Book VIII, of
