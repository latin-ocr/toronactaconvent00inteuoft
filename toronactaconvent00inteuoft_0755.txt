Latin Epigrams on Etienne Dolet

MALCOLM C. SMITH

French Neo-Latin poets exchanged epigrams in the 1530s (and later)
on any and every pretext.¹ It is not surprising, therefore, that many
epigrams are dedicated to Dolet, or have him as their subject. But the
epigrams on Dolet are of particular interest. For one thing, they seem to
be exceptionally numerous: Ι have discovered well over twenty people who
wrote Latin epigrams on Dolet, and a total of about one hundred po-
ems.² Many of them give insight into the particularly complex and intn’gu-
ing personality of Dolet. Many have historica! interest, for Dolet is impor-

¹ As Lucien Febvre showed in his admirable porti-ait of this scholarly milieu in Le
proble'me de l'incroyance au seizieme siecle, La religion de Rabelais (“L’cvolution de
l’humanit6'’), ed. revue, Paris, 1962, Ι, i, 18-104.

² The genre of the epigram is not rigidly defined. J. C. Scaliger, in the section of
his Poetices libri septem dealing with the epigram ([Lyon,] 1561, B.L. 833 124, 169—71),
notes that epigrams are of varied lengths, and adds: “Recipit autern omne genus
Poescms, διαλογικον, sive δραματικον, et διηγηματικον, et μικῐον. Epigrammatum
autem genera tot sunt, quot rerum. Tot versuum generibus explicantur, quot sunt
versuum genera. Tot versibus verborumque generibus, speciebus, formis, figuris,
modis componuntur, quot sunt in quocunque linguae‚ nationis, populi, gentis ambitu
genera, species, formae, figurae, modi verborum'’ (170). Guillaume Colletct, in his
Tmilte de l’lpigramme et tmiue‘ du sonnet, defines the epigram as “Tout Poeme succinet,
qui designc et qui marque naifvement, ou une personne, ou une action, ou une parole
notable; ou qui insere agreablement une chose surprenante de quelque proposition
advancce‚ soit extraordinaire, ou commune,’‘ and adds that “la jurisdiction de
l’Epigramme s'estend sur toutes les matieres, et sur toutes les choses morales, na·
turelles, seintes, et imaginaires” (ed. P. A. jannini, Geneve‚ 1965, 31). Colletet‘s
treatise is an excellent introduction to the genre, especially in the scholarly edition by
Jannini. 1 have accepted as an epigram any poem which its author described as such,
or which is succinet, witty and pointed in the conclusion, especially isit offers a verdict
upon a person. Ι have included one poem (that by Beza on Dolet's death) which the
author classifies in a different genre.
