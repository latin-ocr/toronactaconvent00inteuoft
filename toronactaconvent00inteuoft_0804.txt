778 ERASMUS'S PRECATIONES

has it that the dying Erasmus so concentrated himself on Christ, that only
the sweet name ofJesus was on his lips. The classic account of Erasmus's
last moments is that of Beatus Rhenanus and is included in the introduc-
tion to Erasmus’s posthumously published edition of Origen (1536).
Rhenanus tells us how Erasmus had placed all his trust in Christ and had
died, repeating the words: “O Iesu misericordia” (O Jesus, have mercy),
“Domine, libera me'' (Lord, deliver me), “Domine, fac· finem'‘ (Lord,
bring the end), and then, in Dutch, “lieve God,” which Rhenanus translat-
ed as “chare Deus” (dear God).

Nicolaas van der Blom, in his article on Erasmus’s last words, thorough-
ly analyzes all the information we have on this subject.⁵⁰ He convincingly
argues that the Dutch words “lieve God'’ need not have been Erasmus's
very last words. But this is not what concerns us here. Itis the meaning of
these two Dutch words that interests us. Nowhere in the Dutch religious
language could Van der Blom trace the combination “lieve God,” but he
did find the combination “lieve Heere” (dear Lord). He believes that a
contamination occurred in the tradition, although, in his opinion, the
word “lieve'' was indeed uttered by Erasmus.

In my view, it is very likely that Erasmus spoke the words as they have
been handed down to us. The combination “lieve God’' does occur in
Dutch medieval prayers, for example in prayers where Jesus’ suffering and
wounds are meditated upon. These prayers invoke “the merciful God,”
“the blessed God,” “the perfect God'’ or “the dear God,” but in all cases
this “God'' is Christ, who in these and other prayers is also called Father,
even “almighty Father.''⁵ ¹ Erasmus too, occasionally called Jesus “parens''
or “conditor.'’⁵² Would it be possible that Erasmus had learnt such
prayers in his youth and that a familiar expression had come back to him
when his end was near? Anyway, it is possible that in medieval Dutch the
words “lieve God’' (dear God) refer to Christ. If we accept this, then the
accounts claiming that Erasmus invoked Christ only are true in an unex-
pected sense.

In De praeparatione ad mortem, Erasmus suggests what texts a dying
person could use to express his saith: “LordJesus, receive my spirit” (Act.
