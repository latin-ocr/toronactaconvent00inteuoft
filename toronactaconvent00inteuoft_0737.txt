Grotius and Legal Tradition:
A Study in Ambivalence

ROGER T. SIMONDS

ln Hugo Grotius’s famous work on international law, De iure belli ac
pacis (1625), there is a curious ambivalence toward the European legal
tradition. It is clear that what Grotius does is rooted in that tradition, but
he seems to go out of his way to obscure or minimize his relationship to
it. A study of his treatment of the theory of legal interpretation brings out
this ambivalence, as I shall argue.

Grotius’s reputation as a founding father of modern legal and political
thought rests on two pillars: his advocacy of a “natural law’' theory of
jurisprudence‚ and his development of the theory of international law. His
position is said to be modern in the sense that it seems for the first time

European concepts of imperial sovereignty.

In the field of international law, Grotius is famous for having advanced
the principle of freedom of the seas, the doctrine of the just war, and the
theory that treaties between sovereign nations constitute a valid body of
law independently of any international political power. This theory is
connected with the natural law doctrine in the sense that the notion of
legal validity as applied to agreements between sovereign powers implies
that there are legal pn'nciples independent of the positive laws of those
powers themselves.

The concept of natural law is of course very ancient and is a common-
place among the classica} philosophers, poets‚ rheton'cians, and jurists.
What was new in Grotius, it is said, was the idea that certain principles of
natural law are valid independently of the divine will itself. This is the
famous “impious hypothesis” in the Prolegomena (section ll) to Grotius’s
work: “What we have been saying (about the natural law) would have a
