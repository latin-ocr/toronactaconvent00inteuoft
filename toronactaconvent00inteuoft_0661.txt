this implicit accusation with a long list of more or less dangerous animals
with whom there is no cause to compare him. He mentions (lines 91-110)
the basilisk, the ox, the snake, the scorpion, the horse, the bear, the wild
boar, the porcupine, and the lion. Besides, the fox adds, I cannot bite
because a coughing-fit robbed me of my teeth long ago.

Of these bombastic enumerations from various fields of learning, there
are more in these rables, but these catalogues of Priamel-like forms do not
belong to the sable-genre. The same obtains for the epic words and
phrases and the almost baroque modes of expression in which these
poems abound.

What people in the second half of the fifteenth century considered to
be a fable can be gathered from the already mentioned collection of
Heinrich Steinhowel: short stories in prose or poetry, mostly about
animals, with an attached moral. That people still thought so about thirty
years later is shown by the enormous popularity of the sable-collection of
Martinus Dorpius: here are contemporary versions of old fables, but also
new fables by men like Poliziano. But the overall impression is still the
same. The fables of Bartholomaeus Coloniensis do not fit in at all, and
they cannot be sen'ously considered fables: their length, their exorbitant
vocabulary and the evidently intentional clash between title, contents and
tradition preclude this. It seems likely that these poems should be regard-
ed as an elaborate and amusing parody of the fable as a genre.
