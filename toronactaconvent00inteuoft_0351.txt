Saxo’s history of Denmark is an unusual achievement‚ also when seen
in its proper context, the so-called “Renaissance of the Twelfth Century.'’
ln fact it must have been altogether too difficult for many readers of the
later Middle Ages. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries there are only
few traces of the original version. On the other hand, an epitome written
in current medieval Latin, and omitting the difficult verse passageS, soon
gained popularity.⁵

Prior to the printing of Saxo, in the late fifteenth century, there are
clear signs of an awakening interest in the original version. A grammatical
handbook, printed in Copenhagen in 1493, includes a section on versifica-
tion with the express purpose of enabling the student to read the poems
of Boethius (in the Comolation of Philosophy), Saxo Grammaticus, and other
poets.⁶

A few years later, the Hamburg humanist and diplomat Albert Krantz
began to write his history of the Scandinavian kingdoms, a part of a larger
historiographical project, namely to write the history of that part of
Germania which lay outside the Roman empire.⁷ Krantz is therefore not
a writer of national‚ patriotic history in ²the same sense as the French and
English historiographers already mentioned. Owing to Germany’s particu-
lar status as a federation of territorial states, German patriotic feelings had
some difficulties in finding a specific focus. Krantz’s allegiances lay pri mar-
ily with the Hanseatic League, and his North-Germanic territory com-
prised Saxony, the Baltic Slavs‚ and Scandinavia.

Krantz had access to a manuscript of Saxo, and used him extensively.
Although he discarded what he found untrustworthy, still, many legends
and the whole implicit chronological construction remained. Saxo’s early
history was simply too useful for Krantz’s project to be rejected. Krantz
also acknowledged his debt to Saxo several times, most detailed at the end
of the Norwegian part: “It has pleased me to copy this passage word for
word from our Saxo and insert it here, in order to introduce from time to
time the very voice of the author whom I have followed in these Antiqui-
ties. In this way posterity can observe the care which men of Danish
descent already at that time bestowed on writing. Such considerable
