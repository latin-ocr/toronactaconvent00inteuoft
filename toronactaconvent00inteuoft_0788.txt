762 ERASMUS AND AURELIUS

more programmatic, clarifying presentation of the studia humanitatis as a
practical educational course, Aurelius apparently was hoping to establish
something which was novel for his Dutch readers; and secondly the immense
importance Aurelius seemed to attach to education in history.

It was Jerome, Aurelius stated, who had given the proper example of
how every regular cleric should be educated. Before he ventured into the
field of biblical studies, Jerome practiced the different disciplines of the
studia humanitatis. The fact that Aurelius dedicated a separate chapter to
jerome's historical training, whereas the other disciplines (grammar,
rhetoric, poetics and philosophy) were dealt together in only one chapter,
is typical of the historical preoccupation of the author.²⁰ In a letter of
dedication to the Compendium de origine et gestis Francorum of the French
historian Robert Gaguin, Aurelius had first given his theory on the criteria
for impartial‚true and eloquent historiography.²¹ Now in the Vita jheroni-
mi Aurelius tried to convince his readers that knowledge of the pagan and
Christian history was indispensable for every Christian and certainly for
every cleric. In this general plea for the study of the past, Aurelius used
the famous topoi, which he illustrated with citations from classic authors.
The writing of history “quae veritatis magistra est, nuncius fidelis, testis
verus, benignus interpres, perhenne monumentum et indubitata firmaque
memoria. . .’' was more important and precious than classical sculpture,
the triumphal arches and the Egyptian pyramids. Alexander the Great had
understood this: not from the beautiful building of Athens would posterity
know his glorious deeds, but through the historiographers. And Jerome
also understood, according to Aurelius:

neque se unquam sine veterum historiis atque scriptis, retroactorum
temporum et annorum supputationem posse luculenter comprehen-
dere, neque plurima sibi pro divinarum rerum gestarum consequen-

tia* quam maxime** necessaria nisi per consulum et regum annales

atque successus facile perscrutari.²²

Like Jerome, Aurelius continued, a Christian humanist studied the classics
not only to learn to write correct Latin, but also—and this was no less

philosophia); f. 41-43 (liber 1 caput 5 on historia). The title of the history chapter is:
“Quanta se diligentiaJheronimus ad legendas gentilium et christianorum historias post
artes liberales contulerit et quantum exinde sibi et ecclesiae profecerit.‘’
