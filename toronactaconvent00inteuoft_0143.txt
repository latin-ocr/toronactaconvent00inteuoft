with a general idea of Erasmus’ stylistic preferences but does not supply
him with a definitive list of probati autores to be used as a standard for
revising the Vulgate. In fact, we shall see that in this task Erasmus restrict-
ed himself to a rather narrower circle of authors, since he did not want
the meaning of the text obscured by poetic or archaic usage.

Some examples of revisions justified by reference to probatilpmbi autores
will illustrate this practice: In the first edition of his New Testament (1516)
Erasmus changed poenitentiam agite—the Vulgate version of Matt. 322-10
poeniteat vos, explaining the revision in the corresponding annotation: “I
would not want to label poenitentiam agere (in the sense of ‘being moved by
regrets’) barbarous or unidiomatic, but 1 do not reoell reading the phrase in
probos autm” (LB VI 17F). Since the revision was severely criticized bemuse
of its perceived doctrina} implications—that is, an implied denial of the
sacrament of penance—Erasmus modified his translation in later editions to
placate his critics. The final version read poenitentiam agite vitae prioris.

Elsewhere Erasmus changed genimina (the Vulgate at Matt. 23:33) to
progenies, explaining the emendation by reference to the usage of classical
authors: “I do not think that genimina has ever been found in probatos
autores. For geno, which Varro and Lucretius used for gigno (but in a poetic
composition), is too archaic to be used today by anyone’' (LB VI 20C).

At Matt. 13:23 he replaced centesimum by centuplum, arguing in his note
ad locum that the former was unidiomatic. “It is not yet clear to me
whether centesimum can be found in probos autores in the sense of centenum
or centuplum.” Eventually he discovered a relevant passage in Pliny and
emended the note accordingly. In spite of the classica! precedent, howev-
er, he retained centuplum in the text, perhaps for the sake of clarity.

Erasmus also used arguments based on the usage of probati autores in
his polemic with Jacobus Stunica‚ a collaborator on the Complutensian
Polygot who turned into an obstinate critic of Erasmus’ New Testament
edition.¹² ln half a dozen tracts published between 1520 and 1524 Stu—
nica attacked Erasmus' emendations on both theologica] and philological
grounds. Two of his publications dealt more specifically with matters of
idiom and style: Annotationes contra Erasmum Roterodamum (Alcala, 1520)
and Assertio ecclesiasticae translationis (Rome, 1524). In his replies Erasmus
refused to admit Stunica‘s criticisms, arguing that they were not supported
by evidence from classical authors: “1 am not interested in what can be
said,” he wrote. “Let Stunica proffer what he has found in probatos autor-
