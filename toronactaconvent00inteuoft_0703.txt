Givil Society and State, Law and Rights:
Some Latin Terms and Their Translation

in the Natural Jurisprudence Tradition

M. J. SILVERTHORNE

n the course of translating from Latin into English some writings of the

natural law school of the seventeenth century, I have had some difficul-
ty in choosing appropn'ate translations for several key-words in the area of
political and legal philosophy. The most perplexing have been civitas and
jus and to a lesser extent imperium and summum imperium. Others that
have given some difficulty include respublica, status, and regimem potestas,
potentia, and vires; civis and subditus3 societas and socialitas; pactum and
contractus. The translator faces, of course, the usual difficulties of transla-
tion, that the semantic range of any one of these words does not corre-
spond exactly with the semantic range of any one English word, and this
is compounded by the fluidity in the usage of the Latin words. But the
greatest risk of misunderstanding, and of misleading the reader who relies
on the translation, arises from the fact that the various uses of the Latin
words carry a large clement of what one might call ideological connotation.
Ι intend to illustrate the various uses of the Latin words by showing how
variously certain key words were understood. My evidence consists partly of
lexical remarks in the authors themselves, partly of their usage and partly of
the van‘ety of equivalents found by contemporary translators.¹

¹ Seventeenth-century Latin politica] vocabulary does not seem to have received
much attention, and the work that has been done is not easily available. In particular,
there is as yet no dictionary or word list, and one appreciates the value of the Society's
recent decision to begin working towards a dictionary.
