578 ERASMUS'S SUSPICIONS OF ALEANDER

Aleander shows himself easily disposed to believe the statements being
made that Erasmus suspected the Bull against Luther to be a forgery.³⁸
Within a few weeks they both arrived in Cologne, where Erasmus, accord-
ing to Aleander, paid nightly visits to the Electors in order to corrupt
them.³⁹ Nevertheless, on the initiative of Erasmus, a meeting was ar-
ranged. Erasmus refused an invitation to have dinner with Aleander,
probably for fear of being poisoned,‘¹⁰ but the conversation was an
unexpected success. Common memories revived and the reciprocal
charges of slanderous talk, though not completely groundless, were soon
swept away in waves of laughter. They separated, to quote Erasmus's
version, “with a kiss, the symbol of old friendship.’'‘¹¹

Erasmus’s report of the meeting, given in his Spongia, seems to be
sincere. Aleander, however, frankly confirmed that he, for the sake of the
Faith and of his mission‚ dexterously hid his real opinion as to the part
Erasmus was playing in the Lutheran tragedy.⁴¹²

After Aleander had left for Worms new rumours about his malicious
plans against Erasmus soon surfaced, but once again the air was cleared by
means of letters.‘¹³ This time too there is reason to quesion Aleander's
sincerity since his contemporary report from Worms blamed Erasmus
alone for the progress of Lutheranism in Holland.‘¹‘¹ Later in 1521 the
two had a serious but satisfactory talk of five hours in Brussels where
Aleander accused Erasmus of giving rise to the rumour of his being born
a Jews*5 Relations obviously became friendly again. In Louvain, where
Aleander was ready to show his disapproval of Stunica’s attack on Eras-

³⁹ Cf. Brieger, ac. (above n. 25),p. 52, ll. 20-21. Aleander probably has Erasmus’s
brief encounter on 5 November 1520, with the Elector Frederic of Saxony in mind, for
which cf. Spongia, ASD IX, 1, p. 182, 11. 422-24. According to Erasmus's later state-
ment, Frederic was the only prince he had met with in Cologne3 cf. Ep. 1512, l. 19.

be the author of several Lutheran publications, among which even Luther’s Babylonian
Captivity; cf. Ep. 1218, ll. 13-16: “ex his mihi tribuit Captiuitatem Babylonicam.” Cf.
