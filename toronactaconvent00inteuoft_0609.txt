praised so highly if it had not been real to some extent. Some poems
contain appeals to him for money, pieces of land, and other gifts.¹¹ One
refers to an occasion when Holzel entertained his “proteges” (if that is
what they were) in Linz.¹² The poems frequently contain applications to
be received into the group of Holzel’s amici.¹³ Despite their topical
character even these may in some cases have had a factual background,
perhaps in connection with the Augsburg sodalitas litteraria, of which
Holzel was a member.¹⁴ The poems define the relationship between
Holzel and his poets quite clearly: he gives presents or provides help in
practical difficulties. In consequence the poets acclaim him in their works,
recompensing him with fame and immortality as a result.¹⁵

There are considerations which raise some doubts about the picture
painted by our poems. Even if most of the contributors were dependent
in some way on court patronage, was Holzel an adequate protector? He
had made an impressive career in the Imperial financial administration.¹⁶
But, as we see from the poems, there was one fundamental limitation to
his munificence: in most cases he could not satisfy appeals on his own, but
only on behalf of the emperor. The poets did not belong to his circle, but

¹¹ M. Transsilvanus: equum et nummos (gl'), Celtis: Si centum numeru mihi ducatos,
Ι Ι Quos Cssar mihi largiter dicauit (c3‘, vv. 11-12), Bonomus: Rex mihi iampridem
Fucini tmdere turrim Ι Ι Pollicitus l moneas is tibi saepe iubet (b3'), Cadius: Aurea nam
mihi das fialgemia serta smaragdo: Ι Ι Et sponsalitium munus habere iuba (fl‘). Another
example is provided by Celtis: Non sat erat l tunicam te tribuisse milti. Ι Ι . . . Ι Ι Mox
scythicas pelles et mollia vellem madros Ι Ι Donas (e3').

¹² Celtis: conuiuales epulas et pocula leta (c2‘, v. 5).

¹³ This reception into the circle of Holzel’s ‘friends' is the theme of a curious
poem by Pinicianus, which purports to describe an edifice Holzel is having built for
himself (dP-<1353 it is constructed of different kinds of wood (the German for wood
is “Holz”, a pun on “Holzel”) and is more precious than Solomon's temple or
Fugger's house, nam uariis surgit uatibus ista suis (“bemuse it consists of so many
different poets”). But in the end Holzel notices the absence of a particular trec, the
pine (i.e., Pinicianus), which he immediately takes care to have added to the structure;
sic est cygneis. additus anser aquis (“so the goose was added to the waters of the swans”).
