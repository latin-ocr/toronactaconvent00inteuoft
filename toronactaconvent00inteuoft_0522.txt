498 APPEAL FOR THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN

or snickered, about relationships which might be something or other more
than ideological; but however we today may assess their doctn'nal vagaries
or their communal mode of living, least of all may we pass any judgment
on suffering souls if in their mature sixties they might have found a
fulfillment which had escaped them in earlier years.

When La Badie died in 1674, Anna Maria van Schurman carried on his
work. Among other visitors, William Penn, the great Quaker leader, came
to talk with her and observe her community. La Badie had published a
great deal, and she continued: she prepared a hymnal, Heylige Gesangen,
with a supplement Bedenckingen over de Toekomste van Christi Ko‘ninckrijk
(“Considerations on the Coming of the Kingdom of Christ'’);¹² and
above all she wrote a full length spiritual autobiography and apologia for
their creed, Eukleria seu Melioris Partis Electio, composed in elegant Latin,
so that it would be read by the learned scholars and theologians from
whom she had broken off all connection, but who still remembered her
very well.¹³

Our Neo-Latin Congress meets this year in Canada, in the city of
william Lyon McKenzie‚ who in a real sense is the great-grandfather of
this document which 1 hold in my hand, the Canadian Constitution Act of
1982, La Loi Constitutionelle de 1982. In it we may read Article 15
guaranteeing equal beneflt of the law to all without any discrimination
based on sex, and another Article 28 guaranteeing all its rights and
freedoms equally to male and female. Wherever we have achieved such
progress, we may congratulate ourselves for our good fortune, and as
Neo-Latinists we can remind the world to pay tribute and render honor to
the memory of Anna Maria van Schurman among the many whose strug-
gles made possible our freedoms, our equality.
