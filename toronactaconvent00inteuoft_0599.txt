JAN N. PENDERGRAss 575

punishment, Dolet was indeed fortunate to have found in Jean de Pins
such an eloquent patron. Through the bishop’s influence and the good
will of first president Jacques Minut, to whom the letter is addressed,
Dolet spent only a brief time in the prisons of Toulouse.

The affairs of Church and State intermingle as freely in Jean de Pins’
correspondence as they do in his “curriculum vitae.” There are a good
number of letters addressed to ecclesiastica} dignitaries such as the bish-
ops of Crasse and of Toulon, Denis Briconnet (no. 26) and Agostino
Grimaldi (nos. 1, 12), to the bishops of Pan's (no. 42‚) and Angouleme
(no. 49), to the two popes already mentioned, Adrian VI and Clement VII,
or to the often neglected Barthelemy de Castellane (nos. 4, 7, 8, 28, 35,
37, 63), whose name appears regularly in the epistolary collections of
Erasmus,Jacopo Sadoleto, Alciato, Bembo. . . ‚ and in the Provencal humanist
circle of Denys Faucher, Jean Visagier and Antoine Arlier.²¹ Other letters
are addressed to Jean de Pins’ professional colleagues and friends at the
Parliament of Toulouse, to senators Jean de Langeac (nos. 18, 20, 36),
Etienne Sacaley (no. 6), Jean seguier (nos. 13, 14, 15, 16) and first president
Pierre de Saint-Andre (no. 32), whose son reaps lavish praise as a budding
poet. In his letter to Saint-Andre‚Jean de Pins depicts a typica] scene at the
palace chapel, where he was one day seated next to his senatorial colleague
Jean seguier. As the devotional service was progressing, seguier suddenly
leans over to his friend, whispering humorously into his ear.

I have something, he says, that you will desire above all else, yet for
which you will find it necessary to sacrifice your entire wealth should
you wish to purchase it.

De Pins responds in a similar vein:

1 shall even take out a loan and pay interest if my wealth will not
suffice, provided that this mysterious treasure of yours is truly worth
that much to me. However, in order to avoid your tormenting me

et Merulam, quorum ingenii monumenta etiam ad posteros maximum fructum
attulerunt, atque ididem [sic] ego de his futurum speraveram. Verum, ut video, longe
in contrarium vertit. Nam illi et iuvenes adhuc et pravis factiosisque partium studiis
incensi facile a litteris ad arma prosilierunt, sed in quibus nihil adhuc (ut audio)
detrimenti acceptum est. . . (fols. 166v-167r, p. 52-53). This “Pinmachus quidam'' is
obviously the same individual as described by R. C. Christie (Etimne Dolet, a Martyr- os
the Rmaissance, ed. [1899], 101) 35 the Gascon Pierre Pinache. Cf. the slightly different

version of this same letter in Dolet's Orationoe, pp. 149-51.
