648 LA DANsE MACABRE AND DRURY's MORs COMOEDIA

The Dance of Death found its way also into the printing press in
England. It seems appropn'ate‚ that Lydgate, again, leads the way. As far
as is known, his verses were first printed in part in an English book of
hours pn‘nted in Paris for the English market byJean Bignon for Richard
Fakes in 1521.¹⁸ The earliest extant publication of his full text appeared
in the appendix to Richard Tottel’s edition of Lydgate's Fall ofPrinces,
London, 1554.¹⁹

A metrical Dance of Death in poignant dimeters, in which Death alone
speaks, dramatizes a series of woodcut male and female figures of estate
being seized by death, ornamenting the borders in the so-called “Queen
Elizabeth's Prayer Book’' (1569).²⁰ It shows the continuance of our late
medieval subject even across the radical religious changes of the reforma-
tion and under the very eyes of a calvinistically educated Supreme Head
of the Church of England.

The vital force of the subject is demonstrated by a number of surviving
broadsides or single sheet prints, distributed in the late sixteenth and early
seventeenth century. They turned the traditional ecclesiastical serenity of
the homiletic dialogue between Death and its victims into popular street
songs or ballads sometimes embracing satire.²¹ From hence it will be but
a step to the Dance of Death caricatures of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries.

In one word: the Dance of Death was alive and popular in England
beyond the reformation and well into the seventeenth century. It is
precisely at this stage in the history of the Dance of Death that Drury's
Latin school drama comes into play.
