96 PUNs, PARADOXES, AND HEURISTIC INQUIRY

freedom. There are even more obvious problems. According to Hythlo-
daeus, the largest group of serui consists of criminals from other countries
who would otherwise have been killed. What do we make of the constant
ssow of criminals into Utopia‚ though: criminals acquired, for the most
part, gratis? Or of the Utopian merchants who fetch them? This resembles
what Gary Larson's comic strip calls humor “On the Far Side”; we have a
black comedy that illuminates conditions in the actual world, where
people become fodder. The point is a serious one, signalling a recurrent
Morean preoccupation with the relation between money or property and
life (compare marriage in Utopia and elsewhere) and asking us to recall
conditions for the death penalty in England. We could argue, too, that the
Utopians put to good use, that is, in the service of their commonwealth,
what other countries throw away or waste, simultaneously saving the lives
of these serui and contributing to their reformation. Yet, we could also
argue that the Utopians have found a very cheap solution to their servant
problem; they don’t like hard work and the serui do a lot of the hard
physical labor. This may sound ssippant, even cynical. But long ago Lupton
pointed out how Utopia’s treatment of these criminals suggests that a
“humane policy is also the most profitable‚”¹⁴ underscon‘ng the strange but
inseparable mix of humanity and sels-interest that characterizes so many
practices in this section and generates other, more discomfiting paradoxes.

Here, as so frequently, the mix of humor (often sardonic), cynicism,
irony, and seriousness is a sign of unresolved and unresolvable incongrui-
ties and tensions in Utopia‚ in sixteenth—century Europe, and in the world
as we know it. By preferring servitude to capital punishment (up to a
point, at least), the Utopians have refashioned punishment as it existed in
early modern Europe. No longer is it a manifestation of royal power, in
other words (as it was in Tudor England and other monarchal govern-
ments)‚ but an expression of the social order and values of the common·
weal, punishing violations of the social bonds between and among people
and establishing a punishment that fits the crime.¹⁵ Moreover, Utopian
practices anticipate changes in the criminal system in eighteenth-century
Europe, and we can better understand why the Utopians rely so much
upon shaming mechanisms.¹⁶ But quite different causes—war, sin, crime,
