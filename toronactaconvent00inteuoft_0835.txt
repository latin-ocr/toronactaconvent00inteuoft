cease to be rhetorical, but rather that the counsellor must try to balance
emotions in order to secure moral standards.²⁹

Although our discussion of De consultatione has been far too general to
come to any definitive conclusions‚ it seems possible to sum up a few
general points and formulate a few observations, which will perhaps
stimulate further discussion and study of this work. First‚ De consultatione
is not confusedly written and slavishly modelled after ancient sources, as
has formerly been pointed out. It would seem appropriate to carry out a
detailed compan'son between Vives's work and that of other humanist
theorists of deliberative oratory. Such an analysis would make it possible
to determine to what extent, if at all, Vives is innovative in this field.
Second, the need for high moral, more specifically Christian, standards is
evident in every paragraph of the treatise. This need not be a surprise in
a work written by Vives, and it is consistent with early sixteenth-century
rhetorical theory in general. It seems more important to note that Vives
extends the range of deliberative oratory from political matters to human
deeds, both physical and mental, on the one hand, and that, on the other
hand, in all sections of his theory, man, both as an individual and as a
social being, is the touchstone by which all things are judged. One might
say this particular interest for the human individual is not surprising in a
writer like Vives. However, the definition of the range of deliberative
oratory in terms of all human activities does seem unusual. One could

²⁹ “Affectus non sunt in hoc genere, ut in aliis nonnullis, concitandi et per-
turbandi, propterea quod alienum id videtur a gravitate et probitate, quae in consul-
tationibus exigitur, vellicantur tamen nonnumquam, idque vel ex rebus ipsis per
amplificationem, si ostendantur esse graviores, atrociores, majores, meliores, honori—
ficentiores, utiliores, jucundiores, tutiores, quam primum intuenti videantur, prae·
sertim accommodatis his ad aliquem affectum quo maxime teneatur, vel proximum ei,
ut atrocitas atque indignitas iracundo proponatur, injuria vel contemptus superbe,
alienum bonum invido, honor ambitioso, divitiae avaro, ambiguum dictum suspicaci,
periculum meticuloso, labor segni’' (ed. Mayansius, 254). Vives treats the affectus in
considerable detail at 254-56. The fundamental importance of a proper handling of
affectus is explained by Vives in De ratione dicendi, when he calls them the “facultas
animi, qua de bono vel malo opinato movemur’' (De ratione dicendi 214, ed. Mayan-
sius, 2:164); compare the definition of affectus by Aristotle (Rhet. 2‘.1.8)‚ whose treat-
ment of the subject greatly influenced Vives, but whose definition lacks the moral
quality inherent in Vives’s definition. In the same chapter, Vives stresses that a careful
balancing of emotions is necessary. To this end, it is important, among other things,
to consider the psychological and material aspects of the persons involved (in other
words, the credentials mentioned at the beginning of De consultatione). In the chapter
on decorum (De ratione dicendi 216), he again stresses that the affectus, if handled
improperly, are likely to harm the communicative process (cd. Mayansius, 192-93).
