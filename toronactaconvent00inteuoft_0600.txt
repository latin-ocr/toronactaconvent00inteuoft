576 JEAN DE P1Ns

any longer with such annoying delay, 1 shall let you be sole judge of
both that very costly merchandise of yours and my pn'ce for it.

At that point, Seguier, smiling radiantly‚ pulls forth an eloquent threnody,
written by the first president's son, Martin de Saint-Andre, on the de-
ceased Anne of Brittany.²² The remainder of de Pins' letter is spent in
exaltation of the author's dubious merits. Apparently, the senators of
Toulouse, despite their tremendous workload, could always find occasions
for discussing literary novelties and for entertaining dialogue, albeit, at
times, to the detriment of their spiritual enlightenment.

Still other letters are sent to representatives of the Parliament of Paris,
to first president Antoine Du Prat (no. 9), who later becomes chancellor
of France and promptly receives a congratulatory epistle from de Pins (no.
59), or to the Parisian senators and court magistrates, Gilles Anthonis
(nos. 23, 27, 34), Francis Disque (no. 31) and Francis Deloynes (no. 53).
Letter no. 23 to Gilles Anthonis is particularly interesting, as it conveys
precious biographical information on de Pins’ early years as a student in
Italy. From the letter, it is clear that the author had not contacted his
friend for quite some time, and that he deems it necessary to recount
what had become of himself over the years. His γὲεἰί begins around 1500,
an extremely difficult period, as our humanist states, infested with wars
and brigandage. Anthonis had just left for Paris, de Pins for Italy:

Shortly after you had gone to Paris [he writes]. . . , Ι left for Italy.
There, I spent several days in Venice, hearing lectures by Marco-
Antonio Sabellico, and then in Padua, where Ι heard Giovanni
Calfurnio, both celebrated for their knowledge of Greek and Latin.
Forced to leave because of troubled times and the threat of a Vene-
tian war. . . , 1 went to Ferrara in order to hear the lectures of Bat-
tista Guarini, son of the great [Guarino] Guarini, and did that

²² Assederat hodie mihi vicinus in sacello palatii, dum res divina peragitur,
Seguerius noster senator, egregius homo-ut nosti—tui tuorumque omnium amantis-
simus. Is, ut saepe solet, facete nobis in aurem insusurrans: “Habeo,” inquit, “quod
summopere cupias, sed in quo tuum omne tibi patrimonium profundi oporteat, si
comparare velis.'' Ad quem ego: “Versuram etiam faciam et aliunde faenerabor, si non
id tibi satis videatur, et dummodo tuum istud quicquid est tanti etiam apud nos
aestimetur. Verum ne nos diutius tam molesta cunctatione distorqueas‚ et tuae huius
carissimae mercis et mei quoque pretii, ut libet, te unum solum arbitrum facimus.”
Tum ille subridens protulit e sinu funebres elegos, quos de divae Annae reginae obitu
ut immaturo sic omnium quoque qui saeculo nostro unquam auditi sunt maestissimo

et accerbissimo dominus filius tuus dominus Martinus carcassonensis episcopus edidit
(Ep. 32 fol. 155r, p. 29). Anne of Brittany died January 9, 1514.
