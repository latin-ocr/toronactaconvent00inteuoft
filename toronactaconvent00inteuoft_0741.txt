these general propositions and concrete cases? What principles are
available to guide us in taking such a leap?

It seems that Grotius in 1604, a mere twenty-one years old, had not yet
discovered the importance of this question. Or perhaps he was not certain
how to deal with it. Clearly, if he were serious in pursuit of what he calls
the proeminent science embodied in international treaties, pacts and
agreements, he would have to deal sooner or later with the problem of
interpreting these agreements.

In the De ium belli ac pacis Grotius does present a chapter on this topic,
not near the beginning, where one might expect to find it, but as the
sixteenth chapter of the second book. The basic ideas in it can be de-
scribed quite simply.

There are thirty-two numbered sections in the chapter, which is organ-
ized into five main topics as follows: (1) the presumption in favor of the
ordinary or natural senses of words; (2) what to do in the event of ambigu-
ity or apparent contradiction; (3) the effects of the difference between
favorable and odious agreements; (4) extensive and restrictive interpreta-
tion based on intent; (5) presumption in favor of the promisor in an
obscure agreement. Τὴε ideas presented are for the most part thoroughly
traditional and familiar to anyone well versed in Western jurisprudence,
although they are sometimes dressed in unfamiliar language.

At the outset‚ he argues (quoting Cicero) that in promises what you
meant, not what you said, is binding. “But because internal acts are not of
themselves perceivable, and some degree of certainty must be established, . . .
natural reason itself demands that the one to whom the promise has been
made should have the right to compel the promisor to do what the correct
interpretation suggests. . . . The measure of the correct interpretation is
the inference of intent from the most probable indications. These indica-
tions are of two kinds, words and implications . . .“(409).

He then lays down the rule that “if other implications are lacking,
words are to be understood in their ordinary sense” (ibid.), that is, natural
or current usage. But he gives no reason for this rule, other than to quote
a line from Horace's Art ofPoetry, and in fact it goes potentially counter to
what he had stated first about promisors being bound by thoughts rather
than by words. It is a somewhat weaker form of the Roman—law principle,
that the words in a legal instrument are to be understood in their proper
and common senses (communis usus loquendi) unless it is manifest that the
maker had other senses in mind.⁵ Grotius does give an amusing illustra·
