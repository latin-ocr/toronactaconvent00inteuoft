disciplinarum: his chosen pupil is “honesto loco natus, modicis opibus
instructus, ea corporis firmitate, ut studiorum laborem perferre possit,
ingenio neque agresti, et hispido, nec molli et effoeminato, sed eleganti,
et ad honestatem propenso praeditus'’(397) which does, it must be said,
make his task rather easier.

The basis of his scheme is the study of Latin and Greek literature,
(taken together, and not consecutively as Vives and some others wanted)
“instrumentum . . . ad parandam doctrinae copiam.” At the age of five or
six (“Sextum aetatis ingressus annum”) the boy will learn the two alpha-
bets, “per ludum iocumque,” “non metu, ac verberibus, sed praemiolis''
which recalls other Renaissance educationalists from Erasmus to Mon-
taigne, so that he can read the two languages easily and quickly enough.
In his seventh year he will learn the first principles of both grammars,
declensions and conjugations, in his eighth “incipiat jam aliquid audire,
aliquid legere, idque ejusmodi, ut et ad formandos mores non nihil
conferat, et voluptatem potius adferat, quam magnam ullam animi conten-
tionem requirat,’‘ by means of Aesop's fables, Phocylides’ Carmina in
Greek and Gabriel Faerno's fables in Latin. For the next two years he will
study Xenophon’s De institutione Cyri in the morning and Caesar’s Commen-
taries in the afternoon, in his eleventh year the comedies of Terence,
Plautus, Aristophanes (in expurgated versions); the twelfth and thirteenth
years will be devoted to Theocritus, Moschus, Bion's Idylls, together with
Virgil's Bucolics, Hesiod with the Georgics, and both books of Homer with
the Aeneid, not all in class, however, since the aim for the pupil is “ut sine
cortice . . . nare possit.’' The master must see that he speaks every day and
writes at least every other day. At the onset of puberty he will engage in
“progymnasmata‚ id est, praeludia quasi quaedam, et praecursiones ad
eloquentiam'' especially from Theon the Sophist. Muret laments the loss of
this old-fashioned eloquence in favor of modern pantomimic gesticulation
and verbiage. All this is followed by a frighteningly impressive list of authors
to be studied by this comparative method, including historical works and
therefore geographical works which in turn call for works on mathematics.
At full puberty, around the age of eighteen, he will turn to analytjcs and
dialectic, “non ex barbasorum lacunis, sed ex Aristotele ipso, et Graecis
Aristotelis interpretibus.” After this exhaustive preparation (he admits it is an
ideal from which you should take what you can), the young man will be
ready for a life of literaiy leisure and will never lack spin'tual nourishment,
or for studies in medicine, law or theology.

As well as providing this detailed‚ if somewhat utopian scheme of

education, Muret also spoke of his general views on teaching·method. In
his De doctoris officio deque modo jurisprudentiam docendi (1569) he declares
“curandum esse ei, primum ut vera doceat; tum ut propria ejus artis, in
