250 CREATING HUMANIST MYTHs

field briefly, but for his purposes sufficiently, sketches these works and
thus provides some documentation. But how was Hutten able to solve the
second task‚ to demonstrate the existence of a unified humanist move-
ment? It is with this aspect, one that Overfield ignores, Hutten’s attempts
to develop a particular humanist group consciousness, that this paper is
concerned. In other words, Ι intend to take up the argument where
Overfleld left off. Two unlikely sources, namely two lengthy poems by
Ulrich von Hutten can offer, I hope, some answers to this question. Since
Hutten’s efforts at fashioning a particular humanist group identity precede
the Reuchlin affair, Ι have chosen one earlier work and one that was
written in the midst of the Reuchlin controversy.

The first poem is the last elegy of Hutten’s Querelarum libri duo in
Lossios of 1510, the second the so-called “Carmen rithmicale” from the
second part of the satirical Epistolae obscurorum virorum of 1517. Both
describe fictitious journeys through Germany, both contain extensive
catalogues of German humanists, and both were written in the decade
between 1510 and 1520. In each case Ι will first briefly describe the poem
itself and the context in which it was written and then discuss its contribu-
tion to answering our question.

The Querelarum libri duo in Lossi0s2 are a collection of twenty poems
totaling 1662 lines in which Ulrich von Hutten describes the ill—treatment
he received from his former landlords in Greifswald, Wedeg and Henning
Lotz. In the fall of 1509 Hutten had come as a student to this city follow-
ing some unknown adventure on the Baltic sea. After initially being
welcomed by the two Lotzes, father and son, and well-to-do citizens of
Greifswald, Hutten, after a quarrel, decided to leave and try his humanist
luck somewhere else. In the middle of the winter, on a bitter cold day in
December with the rivers frozen, the young student set out on his journey.
On his way, however, he was assaulted by servants of the Lotzes who
robbed him of all belongings, including a small bundle of poems, and
threatened to kill him.³ Naked, shaken by fever, and with open wounds
Hutten arrived in Rostock, where new friends from the university offered
him food, shelter, and money.

This, briessy, is the incident that prompted Hutten to write the twenty
