The poet's “declaration of independence'’ from the patron’sjudgement
changed the very nature of the relationship between them. The poet was
no longer dependent on the patron, while the latter‘s fame rested entirely
on the poetry of the sponsored poets, or so the Renaissance poets assure
us, claiming the precedent of antiquity. without Horace and Vergil
Maecenas would be forgotten, without Tibullus Messalla, etc.³⁰ This
concept had already been formulated by Petrarch in the famous speech at
his coronation on the Capitol in Rome in 1381.³¹ It is expressed in a
catalogue of patrons of antiquity given by Gadius:

thue tui similes narrem, quis nomina Galli
Sciret: Vergilio ni celebrata forent.³²
Quis moecenatem: nisi doctus horatius illum
Cantasset: uarium musa maronis amat.
Parthenius l priscusque uigent per carmina Marci.³³
Et messala tuis culte tibulle modis.
Statius hos: illos commendat carmine Naso
Viuit et ingeniis quisquis in orbe fauet.
(d2‘, vv. 17-24)

Here the patron has become a requisite in the process of imitation, he is
a means to define the poet and his product. In comparing him to Maece-
nas, the poets compared themselves to Horace, Vergil etc. The compari-
son indicated their own poetical models. The patron was an essential part
of the classical literary pattern; the individua! selected for that role was
virtually immaterial for the execution of the design.

This accounts for the presence of numerous earlier appeals for help in
our collection, for which there would otherwise be little reason. Their
original purpose was outdated by the time of publication. As a patron
Holzel would have felt ssattered by the public display of his generosity only
if these requests had actually been granted. But if we take some expostula-

inuida, Vergilium (bl'). Similarly, Horace had already claimed thc precedent of
Homcr's cpioe (carm. 4, 9, 25-8).

epigrams).
