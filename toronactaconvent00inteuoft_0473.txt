The Beginnings ⁰f Catullan Neo-Latin Poetry

WALTHER LUDWIG

Ι he starting point for my research on Catullus in the Renaissance

was an observation which is probably familiar to all of you. There is
a characteristic Catullan style. It uses Catullan metres, especially the typical
hendecasyllabic, the favorite Catullan vocabulary, Catullan word forms,
modes of expressions, topics and themes. These elements remind the
reader immediately of Catullus, may he be mentioned as a model or not.
Poems of such kind were written for many occasions, on various subjects
in Italy and other countries in the centuries of the Renaissance. Pontano‚
Janus Secundus, Lotichius, and others may corne to your mind. But we do
not know how and when this Neo-Catullan poetry began, how it devel-
oped, how wide spread it was and how it influenced the vernacular
literatures. There are a few more or less detailed studies on some specific
aspects like the Catullan poetry in France or in England or the general
relationship of Catullus and Pontano‚ but on the whole the questions
which 1 just raised remain unanswered in modern research literature. This
is even the case in regard to the beginnings of Neo-Latin poetry in Catul-
lan style. The relevant literature tells you that it began in the Italian

Quattrocento and usually some poets are mentioned who are said to have
imitated Catullus, but they are listed without any order and differentiation
and without any attempt to determine the on‘gin of this poetical style
more closely. In most cases poets like Poliziano, Pontano, Marullo, Becca-
delli, Navagero, and Flaminio appear in the random lists of such imitators‚
sometimes Lovato and Mussato are included, and the term ‘imitator' is
often used so broadly and vaguely that it comprises anything from the use
of a Catullan word to the variation of a Catullan poem, from the develop-
ment of certain stylistic features to the choice of certain topics. The most
recent work which dealt with the influence of Catullus neglected Neo-
Latin poetry totally. John Ferguson wrote in the chapter ‘Inssuence’ of his
