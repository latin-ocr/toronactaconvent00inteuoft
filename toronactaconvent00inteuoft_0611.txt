amicitia. The term can denote any kind of friendly relationship. Amicitia
was not necessarily a relationship on equal terms. The “minor friends’'
(the amicorum numerus of Horace, sat. 1, 6, 62) which concern us here
were expected to fulfill numerous duties for their sponsor.²⁰ They were
in a way attached to the house of their dominum in some cases they lived
there. They were expected to turn up at the salutatio in the morning,
accompany their “friend’' to the forum, to court, even on trips; they might
be back at night to collect their sportula and could expect an invitation to
dinner (even if they were served food of lower qualityl). At various occa-
sions they received gists, which might take the form of a piece of land, a
house, or money to meet the requirements of the equestrian census (and
to allow them to live off its interest). A poet in the house of a rich ‘friend’
was not treated any differently from any other samilian's. He was expected
to produce verses for domestic occasions, sometimes even to extemporize.
In his turn the poet could expect a well—todo amicus to sponsor his reci-
tations and generally to further his recognition as a poet. The patron's
favourable judgment was vital for the circulation of a book. The main
recompense a poet could offer was the promise of eternal fame through
his praise. But that was not always taken too seriously by the dominus, if
we believe the cool assessment of Martial’s poetry by Pliny the Younger:
“they [Martial’s poems] are not likely to last, but he wrote them as if they
were'' (epist. 3, 21).

The vocabulary the Romans used to describe this sponsorship was
curiously imprecise. The word ‘client’ was obviously felt to be too blunt;
understated terms like amicus and amicitia, sodalis, contubernium, familiaris
were preferred;²¹ colere was the term for the behaviour of the “lesser''
friend, fovere and favere denoted the attitude of the potior. The term
patronus was not applied to this kind of relationship in antiquity.

The classical model is obviously the one we find applied in our poems.
If we compare Renaissance patronage to its ancient counterpart, we can
see some analogies. Sometimes there might be a morning reception to
attend, poets might still be attached to the entourage of a nobleman; they
would no longer receive money in order to fulfin the requirements of the
equestrian census, but perhaps be provided with a position at a court or
a living from a piece of land.

The literary application of the classical model to Renaissance condi-
tions, however, posed several problems. In employing the Roman vocabu-
