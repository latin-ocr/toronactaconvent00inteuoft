and the Myth of the W'hirlpools·
os the Caspian Sea

ROBERT W. CARRUBBA

S eventeenth-century thinkers‚ scientists and travelers were puzzled by
the Caspian Sea, the largest inland body of water in the world.
Coven‘ng 143,630 square miles, the Caspian Sea extends 750 miles at its
longest, averages between from 100 to 130 miles in width, and reaches its
greatest depth at 3264 feet. Among the almost countless number of
streams and rivers which empty into the Caspian Sea are included the
Volga, the largest of European rivers, the Ural, the Terek, and the Kura.
The question, then, which confounded speculators was: How does the vast
amount of water which accumulates in the Caspian Sea emerge from it
without inundating the adjacent lands?

Perhaps the most ingenious answer is found in Athanasius Kircher-'s
Mundus ὁίιΙκετ-ιίιηεαε.ι Kircher believed that the Caspian Sea was connect·
ed by underground channels to the Black Sea and to the Persian Gulf.
When the water level in the Caspian Sea reached a height greater than
that of the other two bodies, the Caspian’s water would flow down and
out at points marked by whirlpools whose existence travelers had report-
ed. This explanation presented in the accompanying illustration by Kir-
cher appeared to make good sense since the landlocked Caspian Sea has
no outlets on the earth's surface. In support of this theory, the French
missionary, Father Avril‚ had argued that leaves of a plant grown on the
