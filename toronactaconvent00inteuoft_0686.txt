662 G. J. VOSSIUS AND JOHN MILTON

people sometimes like to suggest.⁸ In Vossius as well as Milton, eloquentia
constitutes a body of arts that, despite their importance‚ nonetheless
remains subservient to the more architectonic “sciences” of politics and
ethics (A &⁹ S, V.xx.5-6). That is, the final stage in human, or “earthly,''
learning consists of cultivating those “organic arts’' that “our noble and
gentle youth” should know and learn to use skilfully, not as goods in and
of themselves, but in order to rule well. They are, first, a “graceful and
ornate Rhetorick,” fit to appear in “Parliament or counsell” as well as in
the “pulpit‚'' an art which is to unfold from the “wellcoucht heads and
Topics’' of logic, the application of which has been deferred until ηοω.
And second, a “sublime,” not common, art of poetry, to be devoted to
“Religious‚ . . . glorious and magnificent use . . . both in divine and humane
things'’ (PW, 405-6). From such remarks it seems to me patently evident
that when Milton speaks of “Poetry” as a “science’' “subsequent, or
indeed rather precedent'' to rhetoric, he is saying something rather more
simple and hoary than profound or innovative. The study of rhetoric and
poesis is indeed subsequent to politics and ethics, but the former arts are
in no sense “precedent’' to either of the latter. As in Vossius, both poetry
and rhetoric are, to quote the very Aristotelian expression Milton himself
uses, but “organic'' instrumentalities ancillary to the further—ie, higher
and more architectonic-ends of “politicall societies.'' In giving poetry
“precedence’' over rhetoric, Milton is only saying that although poetry
.....
tial for effecting right ethical and politica} ends exceeds even that of
forum, council, and pulpit if used properly. From this perspective, poetry
is no more “precedent” to Ethike than criticism to poesis (A ἔθ’ S,
V.xxi.l-8). Professor Rajan's influential essay to the contrary, politics, not
poetry nor poetic inspiration, remains the queen of “humane” learning in
OfEducation.⁹ Of the art of criticism that Vossius places “subsequent'' to
both poetry and rhetoric (A ἔθ’ S, V.xxi.1-8; cf. PW, 216)-i.e.‚ documents
assessing (like Dryden’s Essay on Dramatic Poesie or Pope's Essay οη Criti-
cism) whether literature serves its proper ends with respect to society—-
Milton says nothing specific, interestingly enough, but his opinion of
modern poetasters probably gives some idea of how he envisions such an

art (PW, 405, n. 185).
Some quick conclusions are now perhaps in order. First, comparing
