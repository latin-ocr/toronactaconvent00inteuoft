MINNA sxAFTE JENsEN 47

My soul he has kept in his guardianship3

my body will rise again new and bright‚

yea, be covered visibly in my skin,

and in my own flesh 1 shall behold my God. 10

All turmoil of the world have 1 left,

forest and field, with property, estate, and other riches,
command and honour and more of that kind.

Alas, how very transitory it is!

My name, 1 have firm confidence, 15
will remain of honourable and good memory;

nor has my name been forgotten by God‚

in grace, by saith, in Christ’s blood. 20

of this place that you let me keep

my resting room and wish me peace,

yea, think also of yourselves in so doing,

how soon your days and time will pasS, 25
so that you might learn with all diligence

to improve your lives and end them well.

Pray to God to send you his grace to that end,

for what has happened to me

is certain to befall you each and everyone. 30

however, will endure, for God has written it into his Book of Life. The
third stanza is addressed to his descendants, who are asked not to disturb
his peace, but to contemplate their own deaths and prepare in time. The
combination of painfings, biblical quotations and verse inscription might
be interpreted as a huge emblem with its characteristic triad structure of
picture, title and epigram.

The text and its setting exemplify what Philippe An'es has called “tamed
death”: “A ritual organized by the dying person himself, who presided
