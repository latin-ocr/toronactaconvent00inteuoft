408 ΤΗΕ PROLOGUES OF COMOEDIA SACRA

defence of his own comedy and of comoedia sacra in general against
possible lines of attack. But the length (nearly 200 lines) and the number
of topics touched on give a completely uri-Terentian effect. Like Gnaphe-
us, Sapidus postpones an explicit Christian reading of the play until the
epilogue; in the prologue, he invokes a whole set of acerbic critics, each
blaming some aspect of his work (either making some purely “literary”
point or more radically questioning the whole basis of comoedia sacra), and
some reflecting objections made to the genre in actuality. Here we see
another reason for the popularity of the specifically Terentian form of the
prologue: it was the perfect classical vehicle for engaging in controversy
on the very lively issue of the relation of classical forms to modern,
especially Christian, needs. But Sapidus does not abandon the role of
direct instructor; in giving detailed answers to each group of hypothetical
critics, he goes very much further than Terence in establishing by contrast
with his enemies a positive canon of what is desirable. There is no ques-
tion of leaving the audience to enjoy the play simply as story-telling while
the readers of the printed version may contemplate its moral aims: the
aim of this theatre is to instruct, and the prologue is there to ensure that
the audience is properly prepared for instruction.

Plautus and Terence, of course, show few signs of concern about such
high moral aims. But the consensus of ancient literary theory is another
matter; by the Roman period most types of narrative literature were
commonly held to provide useful models of virtues to be imitated and
vices to be avoided. Donatus applies this dictum specifically to comedy
(5.1) and the idea, just hinted at in Gnapheus,¹⁰ is made much more
emphatic in a great many prologues in comoedia sacra.¹¹ Observing the
blameless behavior of a Ruth, aJoseph or a Solomon will inspire both
audience and young performers and make them better people, while
Zovitius also claims (though in preface, not prologue) that contemplating
the villains of the piece will deter them from evil living. It might almost be
said that Donatus’ view can be applied more easily to comoedia sacra, which
usually has a clear distinction between good and bad characters, than to

quos absque fructu huic parabolae neutiquam
dabitis operam, nec poenitebit ocii.
