The Language of Eternity:
The Role of Latin
in 16th-Century Danish Culture

MINNA SKAFTE JENSEN

l nternational movements have certain recognizable characteristics
wherever they occur. Even so, they never remain quite the same under
new conditions. When the Renaissance reached Denmark during the
sixteenth century, it kept its general features: the revival of ancient learn-
ing, the interest in the individual and the decisive role played by the
printing press. On its way through Germany it had been deeply coloured
by religious controversies, and its first manifestations in Denmark were
closely linked with the discussions for and against Lutheran Protestantism.
Its final Danish breakthrough came in the wake of the Reformation in
1536. Dunâ€˜ng the following decades, it was formed in special ways by
factors such as nationalism, the feeling among the intellectuals of belong-
ing to the periphery of Europe, the growing economic and political power
of the nobility and especially of the kings, their ambitions of regaining the
dominant position among the Nordic countries and a period of relative
economic prosperity. Parallels can probably be drawn from elsewhere to
each and all of these factors, but even so the Danish compound bore its
own stamp. The poem presented below is unusual in being bilingual, but
in other ways it is typical. Since most of the central issues of Danish
cultural discourse towards the end of the sixteenth century are represent-
ed in it, it may serve as a point of departure for this introduction to
Danish culture at that time and the place occupied by the Latin language
within that culture.
