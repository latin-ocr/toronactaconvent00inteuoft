324 LITERARY HYBRIDIZING IN THE RENAISSANCE

Judging from the texts available‚ the two versions of this work are
equally successful. Once the possibilities of this new genre are exploited‚
however, by treating other contemporary subjects, by further fictionalizing
and developing the characters of speaker and audience, their situations
and their relafionships, French will be inevitably more attractive as time
passes. A humanist author like Peletier‚ because he understood the
underlying values of Roman rhetoric, was able through a piece like the
Cohortatio to free his work of rhetoric's superficial restraints as well as
slavish attachment to its language and with it to help nudge the national
literature into an era of unparalleled creative production.
