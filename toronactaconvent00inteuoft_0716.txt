690 MARTIAL IN THE RENAISSANCE

as Vergil, Horace, or Terence, we find the epigrams included in a cata-
logue of books in the library of Charlemagne in about 790? Two great
encyclopedias of the Middle Ages, the Policraticus ofJohn of Salisbury and
the Speculum Quadruplex of Vincent of Beauvais, cite Martial as well. As the
early humanists’ interest in style and eloquence escalated into an attempt
to reconstruct and relive every aspect of ancient life, long before the first
printed edition of the epigrams, Martial received attention from Italian
humanists Lovato Lovati (1241-1309), Geremia da Montagnone
(1255-1321), and Βοεςειεείο.4

The printed editions of the fifteenth and sixteenth centun'es continue
the tradition of serious critical attention to Martial in their methodical,
systematic way. The earliest printed edition of the epigrams appeared in
Rome in about 1470. Between that year and 1670 at least 145 separate
editions were brought out with ever-increasing items in the critical appara-
tus.⁵ The 1470 edition of Martial featured the text alone, but a 1471
edition provided by way of introduction Pliny's epistle to Cornelius Priscus
on the occasion of Martial's death (book 321).6 The epistle subsequently
became standard for many editions through the Renaissance. It was again
included in Georgius Merula’s (c. 1424-94) 1472 edition, along with
Merula's defense of his work. In 1474 Domitius Calderino issued a com·
mentary with the text, a summary of his lectures given at Rome. At the
end of the work Calderino included a defense of his work, too, evidence
of a controversy involving him, Merula, and Niccolo Perotti (1430-80),
whose Cornucopia (1489) on the Liber Spectaculorum and book 1 occupies
one thousand folio pages. It was Calderino's edition, however, with Pliny's
