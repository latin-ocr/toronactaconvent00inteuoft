830 VIVES'S DE EUROPAE DISSIDIIS ET BELLO TURCICO

nabile‘' (480), and those under it are “inviolabiles cunctis . . . nationibus'’
(480). In expounding his program of defensive containment‚ Tiresias exhorts
the Christians to pray for peace, and mentions the war against the Turk only
as an opportunity for a lesser evil: “aut si regnum liberet augere, alienissi-
mum potius, et pietatis hostem, bello impeterent, quam vicinum, sanguine et
mysteriorum initiatione conjunctum‘' (480). His plan is shorn of Scipio’s
vision of glory and wealth‚ nor does it explicitly address the vigorous expan-
sion of the Turks chronicled in the first half of the work.

Even this exposition in the last pages of the dialogue, the appropriate
place for closure, is undermined by the seer’s own doubts: “non puto esse
consiliis locum, nam omnia saevae atque atroces animorum affectiones
occuparunt, nec consiliis est ullus aditus'' (480). When Minos asks him
whether the things he has foreseen will occur, the seer answers “aut
facient, aut non facient'' (481).

Tiresias's wavering response could as well describe the discourse of De
dissidiis. At times the language affirms a single value system and at other
times denies it. The work, like Tiresias's closing prophecy, is Vives’s
attempt to frame a dilemma. Different value systems and their correspond-
ing language worlds and courses of action cross only obliquely as unre-
solved possibilities.

Itis instructive to compare the directed, closed discourse of Alfonso de
Valdes's Dialogo de Mercurio y Caron, an apology of the foreign policy of
Charles V, with the language of De dissidiis. In the Dicilogo of Valdes the
obligatory defense of imperial policy is reflected in the progressive loss of
dialectic tension. Dialogue becomes a monologue voiced by characters
defined at times by little more than the rubn‘c on the page. Valdes himself
refers to this transformation in discourse in the preface to the reader.
While the dialogus mortuorum, he writes, had seemed at the outset to suit
his purpose, it later became so irksome that he was tempted to destroy the
work. Having adopted an “open'’ form—the dramatic dialogus mortuorum
in the tradition of Lucian of Samosata—he found it difficult to close.

In the case of Vives, the “open'' structure which marks other works of
his, in particular the Exercitationes Linguae Latinae, was natural to him,
since he conceived of the examination of the world around him as a
dialogue between object and subject, between objective moral order and
the ssawed‚ subjective tools of human investigation. This dialogue of
continuous opening and closing, of frequently reversible definition, is
inscribed in the discourse of De dissidiis Europae et bello turcico.
