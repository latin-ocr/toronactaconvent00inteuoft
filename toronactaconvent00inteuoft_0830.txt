804 VIVES'S THEORY OF DELIBERATIVE ORATORY

treatment of inventio. For although Vives draws heavily on ancient sources
(especially Aristotle, Quintilian and Cicero, as Bonilla y San Martin already
stated),³ he by no means follows them slavishly, but seems to rearrange
them and, in addition, give new meaning to certain concepts.

When one looks at the global arrangement of De consultatione, one
notes that Vives treats in succession the inventio, dispositio and elocutio of
the genus deliberativum, omitting memoria and pronuntiatio, the fourth and
fifth tasks of the orator. More than four fifths of the work, which compris-
es twenty-five pages in Mayansius’s edition, is concerned with the inventio.
The structure of De consultatione comprises a section which Vives refers to
as materia or seminarium universae inventionis, and a section which he labels
de exercenda Ῑααιίἰαίε.4 The section on materia comprises first of all an
extensive survey of the loci argumentorum a persona which are relevant to
the genus deliberativum.⁵ Secondly, Vives describes the subject matter of
deliberative oratory and discusses the general rhetorical goals at which the
deliberative orator must aim.⁶ In the part called de exercenda facultate Vives
discusses first of all the way in which to handle the raw material of in·
ventio. After having developed this point, he justly remarks that he has in
fact not only dealt with inventio, but also with dispositio.⁷ Next, he briefly
discusses the partes orationis and the elocutio.⁸

After this bn'ef summary let us now look at two interesting points in
which Vives is clearly adapting the ancient theory to his own standards and,
more in general, to those of his time. The first aspect concerns Vives’s views
on the range of deliberative oratory and its character in general.

It is quite striking that when Vives discusses the loci argumentorum (or
consideranda, as Vives says himself) at the beginning of the treatise, he

⁸ One can mention at least three specific points of reference: Aristotle, Rhet.
1.4.1-2; Cicero, Inv. 2.52.157 ff. and Quintillian, Inst. 3.8. See notes 5, 6, and 24.

⁴ The first section covers pp. 238-45, the second pp. 245-62.

⁵ This part begins with a brief mentioning of all the important aspects which must
be taken into consideration in the deliberative process: “Ante omnia considerandum
qui sit cui consulimus, tum qui nos, deinde qui alii consultores, et quibus de rebus,
quo loco, quo tempore, ac rerum statu3 quae sic volo esse a me posita, ut non longis
intervallis cogitanda sint, sed velut uno oculorum aspectu colligenda, conferendaque
inter sese . . .‘' (ed.‚ Mayansius‚ 238-39). Compare, e.g., Quint„ Inst„ 3.8.15.

⁶ The definition of the subject matter is apparently derived from Arist„ Rlzee. 1.4.1-2:
“Deliberan'o omnis ac electio de futuris est, non necessariis, neque impossibilibus, sitis in
manu deliberantis, ut agere ea possit, et non agere . . .” (ed. Mayansius‚ 241).

⁷ “. . . hactenus de inventione, sub qua nonnullis in locis dispositionem quoque sumus
complexi . . .” (ed. Mayansius‚ 258).

⁸ Ed. Mayansius‚ 258-60 (partes orationis), 261-62 (elocutio).
