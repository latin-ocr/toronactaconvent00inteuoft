to enjoy the city in the company of many friends. One of them, to quote
the letter of invitation, would be the Ijegian prince-bishop, Erard de la
Marck’s then chancellor, jerome Aleander.³³ For unknown reasons the
meeting did not take place, and again four years went by. Years, as we
know, full of overpowering events, which radically changed the political,
social, and particularly the ecclesiastical situation in the German Roman
Empire. In this new situation, the two scholars were finally, after twelve
years, to meet again. Aleander came to the Netherlands to win over the
newly chosen emperor for the promulgation of the Pope’s bull Eam-urge
against Luther. He must soon have noticed the traces of strong Lutheran
tendencies among the people of the southern Netherlands, During this
period he presently became aware of Erasmus’s difficulties with the
Louvain theologians in their crusade against Lutheranism. To most
members of the Faculty of Theology, Erasmus was as bad as, or even
worse than Luther. Aleander, on his arrival in the Netherlands, was cer-
tainly disposed to view Erasmus from the same point of view, as appears
from his concern with the famous letter Erasmus had written to Luther
one year before.³⁴ Against the author’s will, this letter had been printed
and soon a copy of it had arrived in Rome. Aleander had revealed his
worry about Erasmus’s kindness to Luther in a message to his former
Liegian patron, Erard de la Marck.³⁵ From then onwards, distrust would
predominate in Erasmus’s view of the personality and the activities of
Aleander.

Aleander, on his side, was filled with suspicions about Erasmus’s part in
the Lutheran question, and these suspicions soon became convictions.
One of his extensive reports to his superior, Cardinal Giulio dei Medici,
the future Pope Clement, leaves no doubt about that. It seems almost
naive that Aleander, according to this repon, still expected Erasmus to pay
him a fn'end’s visit during his stay in Antwerp or louvain, where he was
to organize his first anti-Lutheran book burning.³⁶ In some lines earlier

in the report, Erasmus is depicted as the “fomes malorum,” the kindling-
wood of all the fires of dissent in Flanders and the Rhine region.³⁷
