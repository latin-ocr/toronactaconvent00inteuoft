Erasmus 's Precationes

J. TRAPMAN

p rayers were an important matter to Erasmus.¹ This is demonstrated
by the frequency with which he cn'ticized or ridiculed their abuse:
the mindless rattling off of all too often misunderstood Psalms, praying
for things inconsistent with christian ethics, and invoking the help of some
saint specialized in a particular illness.

Erasmus's criticism is comprehensible only if we assume that he was
convinced of the value of sincere prayer. Although in the Enchiridion
prayer and knowledge are called the weapons of the christian soldier,² the
subject of prayer itself is barely touched upon, which led Alfons Auer to
conclude that Erasmus was not that strongly committed to praying.³ We
should bear in mind, however, Erasmus’s view that, first, neither of these
weapons should ever be laid down; and, second, that knowledge (that is to

privately, in “the inner chamber'’ to use the words of Matthew 626. That
Erasmus accorded prayer a central role appears most clearly from his
comments on the Sacrament of penance. Without rejecting this sacrament,
