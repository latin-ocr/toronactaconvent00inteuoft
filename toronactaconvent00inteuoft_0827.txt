father—andwn-conflicts played an important role in Jesuit educadon, the
subject was particularly attractive. Yet, it never grew as popular as the
conflict between Henry VIII and his chancellor Thomas More, who had
refused to accept the king as the Supreme Head of the Church and who
had been executed for that offence in 1535.

Thomas More's extraordinary popularity on theJesuit·stage is based on
various characteristics of the subject and his person. His conflict with the
king had taken place 350 years after the struggle between Henry II and
Becket, and thus was of greater topicality for the Jesuits. Moreover,
Thomas More's fate was strongly influenced by a woman, namely Henry's
second wife Anne Boleyn, who in jesuit plays is portrayed as a sinful

children he led a devout life, completely in keeping with Jesuit ideals. He
was renowned as a very capable statesman, an impartial judge, a wise
councillor and, what is stressed by the Jesuits, an author of religious
writings. No wonder they made him a hero of their plays, the more so as
the audience seemed to have loved him more than other protagonists. 1
think they loved him for his encouraging example and for his steadfast-
ness which even the sight of Fisher's bloody head could not shake.²⁷ To
my mind, it was, in particular, the willingness of the layman Thomas More
to die for his saith which deeply impressed the audience and made them
weep when he laid his head onto the blockl²⁸
