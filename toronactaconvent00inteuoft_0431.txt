When actually performed‚⁷ the use of a Terenfian, rather than the
Plautine, scene-setting type of prologue goes further: it carries apologetic
(literary‚ and potentially theological) from the written text into the live
performance, and brings theoretica! concerns in front of the audience.
But in the prologues of the immediate successors to Acolastus, the strictly
controversial. tone typical of Terence (corresponding to Donatus' relatizms
type) is less prominent. There is also a change in subject-matter with a
switch towards the moral and religious. This second change is not too
surprising. Where writers wish to claim a moral or religious purpose for
their play, it becomes natural to make that claim at the play's first appear-
ance, which regularly after Gnapheus is the first performance. The audi-
ence is alerted to the play's on‘entation, and the statement forms a nice
variation on the captatio traditional in the comic prologue: “usten, you
will be instructed. . . .” Although this pattem is not found universally, it is
very common and forms the basic message of the prologues of such works
such as Zovitius' Ruth (1534), Crocus'Joseph (1535) and Papeus' Samarites
(1537). Such prologues sometimes also contain a few brief points on
literary matters. That of Macropedius’ Asotus actually deals with these
points in some detail in an “address to the learned,” but more normally
the detailed defence of the poet’s use of metre, observance of or failure to
observe the unities, and similar points, will be placed in the prefatory let-
ter, 'so excluded from the actual performance. The moral point must be
got over immediately; metrical niceties could await publication. The
preface itself, however, also frequently contains more religious—moral ma-
terial, giving a lengthier and more heavily documented treatment of the
appropn'ateness and usefulness of the comedy, or of comedy or even clas-
sical learning in general.⁸ More often than not there are areas of overlap
between preface and prologue, while the prologue is made to treat mat-
ters of far greater complexity than the Terentian model ever approached.

Perhaps the most striking example of what by Roman standards would
be a heavily over-loaded prologue occurs in the Anabion or Lazarus play of
Iohannes Sapidus, written in 1539.⁹ Here there is a return to the Te-
rentian relativus type of prologue, in the form of a long and detailed

⁷ It is of course theoretically possible that the printed text could have been
substantially revised before publication, but there is no evidence for radim} changes.

⁸ The extreme example is the preface to Crocus’ Joseph, which in effect forms a
separate essay on the desirability of the study of selected classical texts.

⁹ Outside strictly sacred comedy, we might compare the prologue of Bassams
(1540).
