the “Authors of Agvimdture‚'’ the study of whom he wants to coordinate
with either geography or a “compendious method of naturall Philosophy’'
(PW, 387-90), presumably but an introductory Latin survey of the studies
on this level still to come, since the original, primary texts themselves
would in fact have been couched in Greek, not Latin.

For without Greek, so Milton’s thinking seems to run, it is impossible
to read such “philosophy.” Greek, not Latin or the vernaculas, is the
language of true “science.’' Accordingly, the Hellenic strand must intrude
into his scheme at this point, and so students will have to return to the
level of Vossius's artes populares and begin anew with acquisition of basic
language skills, this time in the Greek on which access to the world of
natural and ethical philosophy is going to depend (PW, 390; cf. A &⁷ S,
V.iii.l-l9). Thereafter Milton recommends hastening “after the same
manner'' through the Greek curriculum indispensable to picking up
“encycliopaideic” subjects such as the principles of arithmetic‚ geometry‚
and geography that want of Greek evidently precluded from the Latin
track earlier (PW, 391; cf. A ἐν’ S, III.i.l). As Milton's Greek program
makes especially clear, the true objective in OfEducation is not Emycliopai·
deia, as is sometimes suggested, but “philosophy'' proper. That is, if the
end of “learning'’ is to “repair the ruins of our first parents’' and arrive
“cleerly to the knowledge of God and things invisible'’ by the “orderly
conning over'' of “the visible and inferior creature’' (PW, 366—69), then
Polymathia can be no more than a stepping stone to greater and nobler
learning (cf. A &⁹ S, V.i). In light of De artium et scientiarum natura, it also
seems apparent that in this stage of Greek studies, philosophy to Milton
really means what Vossius terms “operative” sapientia as opposed to
speculativa—that is, “applied science'’ rather than “theoretical” (A &² S,
V.v.l; vi.1). Indeed, Milton‘s emphasis in Of Education falls explicitly on
things “usefull to be known,” the “solid things'' in the “convaying''
instrument “language” (PW, 369). Hence, the subjects to which he now
turns all seek a “reall tincture of natural knowledge” (PW, 394): viz.,
fortification‚ architectum, “Enginry,’' navigation, the “History of Meteors‚''
mineralogy, “plants and living creatures as farre as Anatomy,” medi·
cine—all complete with laboratory and field work, and fortified with
readings in the versified scientific treatises inherited from classical antiqui-
ty‚ ranging from the Orphic Hymns and Hesiod to Lucretius and the rural
Virgil (PW, 391-96).

Finally, Milton's third and last strand emerges. As one can see in my
diagram of Vossius's scheme of the arts and sciences, “philosophy'' divides
into two branches, Natural Philosophy and Ethical Philosophy. Of these
two, Pkysike is lesser and therefore anterior to Ethike (A (⁶9⁹ S, V.iv.1-9).
