494 APPEAL FoR THE EDUCATION or WOMEN

treatise De Termino Vitae by Menasseh Ben Israel was published that same
year in response to Beverwyck but it was printed entirely separately. While
some of the sources in Anna’s and in Menassah's analyses overlap, there
is no sign of any cross consultation between them, although there is
indication elsewhere that they were at some time acquainted.)⁷

The necessity of schooling for women was then uppermost in her mind.
As early as 1632 she mentioned in a letter to Andreas Rivetus, the Leiden
theologian‚ that she was drafting something on that issue in French. About
1638 she had recast her arguments into a Latin dissertation and she sent
it to Rivetus. An exchange of letters followed, which apparently was not
entirely pn'vate. In his letter of 18 March 1638 Rivetus summed up the
smug dogmas of the divinity school: Multum vales ad persuadendum, sed hic
tamen frustra es, “you are powerful in persuasion, but you are nonetheless
wrong, your efforts are in vain.” God, he told her plainly, (God, whose
will was clearly known to Andreas Rivetus) has destined men and women
in different directions. Surely she must remember how Odysseus demon-
strated that fact when he exposed Achilles who was trying to hide among
the maidens. Since women are not suited for political power or responsi-
bility in the chureh, why should they seek to study for those roles. The
Apostle Paul bade women not to teach or hold authority over men, but to
abide in silence. True, he would grant her that women should not be con-
demned to the colander and the spindle alone, but, said he, the proper
scope of women's education had been set forth a century before by
Ludovicus Vives, De Institutione Foeminoe Christianae. (Vives had written, for
Henry VIII’s first wife Cathen‘ne, directions on how to fit demoiselles to
become wives of courtiers, mothers of their children, and retired widows
in due course). The war-winning roles of Deborah and Jael in the Hebrew
Scriptures were rare exceptions, he went on, and see how Joan of Arc
came to a bad end, even her admirers questioning her maidenly virtue
(Rivetus was French by nationality). He adduces the practical problems: it is
simply improper to mix boys and girls in a coeducational setting, and it is
just impossible to find a corps of erudite to staff a women’s college, so
better women should read what they need in their home-learned vernacu-
lar, in humility and in modesty.

Faced by such obduracy, Anna Maria van Schurman restrained her
feelings as best she could. In her letters she rebutted Rivetus's gross
fallacies and gross unfairness with eloquence and with reason, but tactical-
