PETER SHARRATT 667

In his early years in Venice Muret published three inaugural speeches
usually referred to together as De studiis literarum, but bearing individual
titles: De laudibus literarum (1554), De utilitate ac praestantia literarum
humaniorum adversus quosdam earum vituperatores (1555), and De philosophiae
et eloquentiae conjunctione (1557). The first of these is a public display to
the Senators of Venice of his capabilides, in order to obtain a chair of
literature, and stresses the value to the state of learning, and more precise·
ly of “literarum disciplina‚’' both to preserve the state and increase its
prosperity; the aim of government is “felicitas publica‘’ which depends on
the happiness of the individual, and therefore on his virtue which in turn
depends on literature or learning. No state can flourish properly without
“literarum cultura.’' Muret is not saying that it is impossible for the
unlettered to be useful citizens but that all civic leaders must have a
literary formation if they are to be ready for their duties in peace-time and
in war. It will be noted that the liberal arts are praised not for their
inherent merit but for their usefulness. Lambin too believed strongly in
the usefulness of literary studies to the state and his own penchant was
towards moral and political exhortation. Yet Muret is also concerned with
the effect that learning (“discendi cupiditas”) has on the individual, as the
example of Archimedes, Chrysippus and Solon shows, as well as with the
pleasure which literature provides. The subject was delicate since literature
was often attacked because of its immorality and its futility, either on the
moral and psychological grounds of Plato’s Republic, or on the religious
grounds of the Christian rejection of “voluptas,” from St. Basil through
Vives to T. S. Eliot and beyond. Like many of his contemporaries Muret
speaks pejoratively of literature as the seductive song of the sirens and as
the fruit of the lotus. Pierre Galland‚ for example, in a reply to Ramus’s
work on university reform (1551) was worried that the new vogue for
literature would lure students away from pure philosophy, Turnebe attacks
imaginative writing explicitly, and, for both, the poet is meretn'cious and
a corrupter of youth. Lambin, too, points to the dangers of rhetoric and
of poetic fable.⁴ Muret‚ however, distinguishes two kinds of pleasure:
