but only the cn‘ticism of literature, a discourse about literature.¹⁵ Yet
most would agree that it is possible to acquire a “competence in litera·
ture‘' (F. R. Leavis) or “literary competence” (Ionathan Culler), which
does not seem far from the Ciceronian “literarum scientia’' to which
Muret and his contemporaries aspired.¹⁶ There is broad agreement today
that the study of literature develops “intelligence and sensibility,”¹⁷
which echoes the traditional view of “animi cultura” and is very close to
what Muret sayS, and these concepts have been minutely analyzed and
refined by many educationalists in the last fifty years. There is perhaps less
agreement about the ethical value of the teaching of literature, yet all
commentators list the personal values which a study of literature can help
to develop, and all stress the value to the state of the formation of mature,
responsible, tolerant citizens with a common culture, though some point
to the dangers inherent in this.¹⁸

Although teachers still consider the study of literature to be largely
non-vocational (liberal as opposed to servile, gainful mechanical arts or
sciences), many emphasize the practical uses to which it may be put, and
all, I imagine, believe that is useful in some way or other.

My contention is that a study of Muret's views of teaching literature
may help us to return to a broader, less specialized definition of the
subject, to reassert its place in the university curriculum, redefine its
relation to other subjects, and convince the skeptical of its necessity for
the well-being of our society.
