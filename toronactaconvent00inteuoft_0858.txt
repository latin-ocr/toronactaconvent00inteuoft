832 THE LATIN POEMs OF TYCHo BRAHE

He was born in 1546 as the eldest son in a family belonging to the
highest aristocracy. He was therefore sent on the usual grand tour of
several German universities to study the subjects that would be of use in
a career in politics, law in particular. What he learned, though, was
astronomy and chemistry. On his return he settled down in his native
Scania (then part of Denmark) to pursue these, for a nobleman, quite
unsuitable interests.

We have a letter of his from 1576 which gives a clear impression of his
situation in this period. Tycho writes to a close friend, a professor at the
university of Copenhagen, that he has decided to move to Basle, in order
to get the right facilities‚ and the right milieu, for his studies. He obviously
felt that the traditional ideals of the nobility made it impossible to him to
pursue his scientific interests seriously. In the letter he complains about
having to associate with so many others of his own class, which is utter
waste of time, and then goes on: “You know how alien is the behaviour of
these noblemen to my way of life—and to philosophy itself. There are
exceptions‚ but I do wish there were more of them.'’² However‚ his plans
came to nothing: in the very same letter he announces that the king, Frederic
II, has offered him the island of Hven in the Sound between Copenhagen
and Elsinore, and the money to build a castle there. This became one of the
most impressive prestige projects Denmark has seen, a scientific acade-
my—named Uraniborg or Uraniburgum after the muse—which Tycho ran for
twenty years, supported with huge sums by the crown.

Latin poetry played a great part in life at Uraniborg, at least to Tycho.
We have all kinds of poetry from his pen, from impromptu epigrams, over
single verse lines dispersed in the prose of his scientific works, to more
ambitious poems of several hundred verses. Some belong to private life,
others are distinctly official, like the dedications in his printed works, or,
in another way, the many inscriptions at Uraniborg. The latter were
obviously intended mostly for the many guests that frequented the place,
and they were indeed all printed in the official description of the house.³

² Letter to Johannes Pratensis, 14. 2. 1576 (Opera omnia, 7: 26): “Cum mei ordinis
hominibus, quoniam crebrius mihi agendum est, praesertim Herressuadij, Avunculum,
quando apud ipsum dego, convenientibus, aut etiam me ipsum Knudstorpij invi·
sentibus (alias enim quantum possum illorum consortia subterfugio) multum temporis
mihi perit, multa alias ingrata audienda et facienda. Nosti enim quam sint nobilium
horum mores a meis institutis alieni, quamque ab ipsa philosophia. excipio exci-
piendos, quos tamen plures esse mallem quam sunt.”
