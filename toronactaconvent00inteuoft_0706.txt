680 LATIN TERMS AND THEIR TRANSLATION

natural law was Latin. In its development all writers share some similar
vocabulary and yet use it in diverse fashion. There are on the one hand a
number of key words typical of the tradition, among which are those
mentioned earlier in the paper—civitas, imperium, jus and lex, pactum, and
contractus, etc. On the other hand, given the diversity of religious and
political positions argued within this tradition, it was natural that these key
words should be used in a variety of senses; and these are seen with
particular clarity in contemporary translations. I turn first to the uses and
translations of civitas.

Civitas and civilis societas

Civitas is the word normally used in the Latin works of Grotius,
Hobbes, Pufendorf and his commentators for an independent political
entity.12 The twentieth-century translator's first inclination is to translate
civitas normally as “state” The difficulty with this is that seventeenth
century translations into English do not use the word “state'' in this sense
of independent political entity. The translation of De Cive, published in
1652, uses “civil society'' very frequently. A well-known translation of De
Officio Hominis et Civis by Andrew Tooke which achieved a fourth edition
in 1716 uses “civil society‘' (e.g., 2.8.ll) and “community'' and even
“society’' indifferently as in 25 passim. In the chapters of the Second
Treatise where he is dealing with topics which in Latin natural law treatises
have titles which include the word “civitas‚”John Locke has “Of political,
or civil society'' (c. 7) “Of the beginning of political societies” (c. 8) “Of
the end of political society and government'' (c. 9).

Thus to translate “civitas'' we have seventeenth century authority for
“civil society,'' “political society,’' “commonwealth” and “community.”
What we do not have authority for is “state.''

By far the most common translation of civitas in English was “civil
society.”¹³ But “civil society'' is not of course a direct translation of

¹² Locke, t00‚ explicitly recognizes civitas in this sense at Second Treatise os Govern·
ment, chap. 10, para. 13, where he speaks of “any Independent Community which the
Latines signified by the word Civitas'’ and argues himself for the translation ‘com-

monwealth.’ That translation requires further explanation, as does Hobbes, Leviadmn,

Introduction p. 5 “For by Art is created that great LEVIATHAN called a COMMON
-WEALTH or STATE (in Latine CIVITAS) which is but an Artificiall Man.” Suarez by
contrast normally uses respublica, e.g., De Legibus ac Deo Legislotore 1.2.1.
