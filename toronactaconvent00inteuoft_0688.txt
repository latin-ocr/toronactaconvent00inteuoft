664 G. J. VOSSIUS AND JOHN MILTON

of and suspicious cantion vis-a-vis the sister study of logic) reflects at the
very least a marked antipathy towards the theoretical and abstract as
opposed to the practical or “prudential.’' Furthermore, as the emphasis
upon “philosophy'' natural and ethical suggests, Milton is one with the
likes of Vossius in drawing upon the world of professional classics, particu—
larly the Hellenic, for his inspiration. Anything but enamoured, evidently,
of cramped pietism that too often informed the mainstream of revolution-
ary Puritanism seeking to alter religion, state, and schooling in England
when he composed OsEducatio‘m he preferred the magnanimous values of
an Athenian politeia as not the early but the later sixteenth and the early
seventeenth century conceived it, an ideal city state ruled by enlightened
patricians serving the common good. Would it be too much to suggest
that with Vossius, Milton shares a Reformed vision of not so much a
“liberal'’ as a “philosophical” education? One conceived on the continent
in the tradition not of Zwingli or the Comenians indeed, as some thought
in pre-Yale days (cf. PW, 184-86)‚ but of Beza and anti-Ramist pro·
grams¹⁶ espoused by Reformed institutions of higher learning above all
in the Dutch republic, then still a loose union of sovereign provinces
largely run, appropriately enough, by more or less “Aristocratic’' city
oligarchies? As for critical theory, lastly‚ it seems quite clear, as I have
argued elsewhere,¹⁷ that Vossius regarded poetry and poetics as an in-
strumental “science,” as ancillary to ethics and politics as preaching and
political oratory. Despite Milton’s seeming modernity to many, the argu-
ment in OsEducation makes no attempt to nudge poetry into the category
of—to use Aristotelian terminology—a “productive‚’' or as we might say, a
“fine'' art. In 1644, at least, Milton publicly claims to think of poetry not
as art for the sake of art, or art for the sake of form, or art for the sake of
the artist, but art for the sake of society and betterment of human exis-
