doing reinforce the centrality of the text, the Word, and also place it well
within the competence of the educated layman. All this coincides with
(and probably to some extent assists)‚ the dn'ft of the Reformation. The
most famous of all Loci communes were the work of a humanist theologian,
Philip Melanchthon, who from 1521 established the method of drawing up
heads, or articles of religion, den‘ved from and supported by quotations
from the Scriptures, as the new dogmatics of the new religion: “for the
doctrine of the Church is not derived from demonstrations, but from
sayings.’'¹¹ It also became the ground on which the debate with the
Catholics was conducted, thereby engendering commonplace books with
a Catholic bias aimed at supplying weapons for controversy, as well as
provision for sermons now based on and amplified by the places of
rheton‘cal invention learnt in the humanist schoolroom.¹²

In his advice for making commonplace books for secular studies, De
Locis communibus ratio (1531), Melanchthon contended that the places, or
heads, into which the book was to be divided were far from arbitrary or
conventional.¹³ They were “the forms or rules of all things, drawn from
deep-seated patterns in nature.” This conviction enabled him to transfer
the commonplace-book formula without difficulty to dogmatics, but raises
wide issues with which any history of the commonplace book will have to
grapple. Was its effect to inhibit new thought, because it implied that
every new text, every new discovery had to find a place in the corpus of
received wisdom, which was itself the Book of Nature? Is the prestige of
commonplace books and their lengthy survival in the education system to
be explained by the fact that they contained the consensus, even connived
with the doxae of the dominant political and social power-structure? To
begin to answer these questions one would have to examine not only the
titles of places and the range of quotations transcribed, but also the order
