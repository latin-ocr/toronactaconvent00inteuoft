to invest piety with this impetus orationis so as to give it personal force: in
the De Animi Tranquillitate‚ written as it is after the crisis year of 1542 and
addressed to a refugee from the Inquisition in Lucca, he appropriates the
Reformers’ dynamic conception of saith in an effort to satisfy the need for
personal assurance of salvation. Such an attempt to have it both ways
appears highly typical of other conciliatory (or ambivalent) figures like
Sadoleto or Flaminio who bring a classicizing sensibility to religious
discourse. In fact it is tempting to see some affinity with the formula of
double justification agreed by Contarini and Melanchthon at the Diet of
Regensburg in 1540. It was the collapse of that proposal which marked the
beginning of the end for theologia rhetorica.

But that was in the future: for the moment I want to focus on the
Commentatio Theologica. It is difficult to separate the work from its recep-
tion, recorded in the confident list of friends who had approved it, Sir
John Borthwick, Panagius Hoccedius, Stephen Gardiner and his nephew
Germain. Borthwick, enseigne of the Scottish Archers, would be con-
demned as a heretic in absentia by a Scottish court in 1540; Germain
Gardiner, secretary as well as nephew to Stephen Gardiner and author of
a tract againstJohn Frith, would be hung and disembowelled at Tyburn as
a papist four years later; his uncle, like Lorraine's secretary Hoccedius,
followed a more circumspect path, yet he too would be in the Tower by
1548. It seems very likely that the Commentatio was circulated in manu-
script when the court visited Lyons in 1538 and Stephen Gardiner was
present as English ambassador; in that case there was still little sign of the
grim future which awaited its readers. ln this respect it stands as a para-
digm for the disintegration of humanist reform.

The book, which Wilson also refers to as a precatio, is made up of some
three hundred and forty-five prose verses or aphorismS‚ comparable to a
psalm structure: each verse contains matter for reflection but forms part
of a wider discourse, addressed to the soul and to God. Very much in the
spirit of Erasmus's Modus orandi Deum, Wilson employs a reflexive rhetoric
which is aimed at the suppliant rather than the recipient; in fact, the
reader is actively an orator in two senses of that word, defining the role he
must enact.¹⁵ Given the density of scriptural quotation and allusion in

sed ut assuescamus ea quibus egemus ab illo sperare, utque desyderium aeternae vitae
magis ac magis ascendatur in nobis, dum frequenter hic animum intendimus, ac
ardenter petamus ab eo, qui solus dare potest.'' Modus Orandi Deum (Lyonst T.
Paganus, 1542), sig.b6v-7. Cf. Charles Trinkaus, In Our Image and Likeness (London,

1970), 1:12, where he discusses Petrarch‘s practice of meditation.
