joined with him to be equal co-leader of a small Quaker-like sect in a
community of devout pietists forced to move from place to place seeking
refuge from persecution by their self-styled Christian neighbors.¹⁰

La Badie had begun as aJesuit in France, broke from them, and was
accepted by Huguenot congregations, but he continued to evolve his
religious ideas into a more radical Christianity of the inner light. Exactly
when their association began to develop is unclear. La Badie came to
Geneva in 1659, when he was beginning to have difficulties in keeping, or
obtaining, a regular church appointment because of his novel preach-
ments. It was in Geneva that Anna Maria’s brother was first attracted to
La Badie, but the date is not precisely recorded. It was also in 1659 that
the poet John Milton, who was himself a thoroughly unorthodox radical
in religious doctrine, tried to arrange for La Badie to come to London
and take over the French church there, whose pastor Jean D'Espagne had
just died. Milton's letter, 21 Apn'l 1659, says that he extended the invita-
tion on the recommendation of (his colleague in the Interregnum adminis-
tration) John Dury, who was widely known in the Netherlands and Switzer-
land as the advocate of Protestant church unity.¹l Milton’s letter does not
mention that John Dury's wife was the former Dorothy Moore, who had
been a close friend of Anna Maria van Schurman in the 1640s3 they wrote
to each other in HebreW, and Dorothy Dury also composed a (then
unpublished) proposal for women's education in England.

La Badie did not go to London, but after a while developed his own
congregation of loyal followers which moved back and forth between the
Germanies and the Dutch provinces. In La Badie’s personality and in the
tenets which he preached Anna Maria van Schurman found an appeal
which drew her totally away from her former pursuits. She quickly became
his recognized full equal sharer in the leadership of his community.
Perhaps among the so-called orthodox there were those who whispered,

citations. La Badie was much discussed in late seventeenth-century discourses on
heretiml thought, and is amply treated in many scholarly reference works.
