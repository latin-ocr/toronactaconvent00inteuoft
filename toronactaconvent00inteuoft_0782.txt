756 ERASMUS AND AURELms

For some reasons it is even tempting to see a portrait of Aurelius in
one of these four regular canons. At the time the painting was commis-
sioned, Aurelius was one of the outstanding members of the Congrega-
tion. Besides he was the biographer of the patron of the Congregadon, S.
Jerome, and in a way he deserved to be portrayed. Can it be Aurelius
whom we see in the left foreground of this painting?

By introducing Aurelius and his life of Jerome Ι hope to show why this
one of the four canons has my vote. The most important facts of Aure-
lius’s life you can find in my thesis;2 in this paper Ι concentrate on his
Vita gloriosi Jherom'mi, written between February 1508 and July 1516. This
Vita has been preserved in a contemporary, early-sixteenth-century manu-
script which is kept at the Athenaeum Library in the Dutch city of Deven-
ter. Before we speak about the cultural and intellectual background of this
Vita and its possible influence on the Vita Hieronymi of Erasmus, we
should first have a closer look at the manuscript and its contents. The
work is in a contemporary copy, apparently made for the library of the
so-called Heer Florens house, where Aurelius had stayed in the fourteen-
seventies while studying at the Lebuinus school in Deventer. The Vita
gloriosi Jherom‘mi was copied by the same person who made a copy of his
Marias, the famous imitation of the Parthenice of the Italian Christian poet
Baptista Mantuanus or Spagnuoli. This work was sent by Aurelius to his
Deventer friends before his journey to Paris in August 1497 and apparent-
ly he later did the same with his biography ofJerome. In both cases the
brethren found the works interesting enough to copy them, or they
ordered copies directly from the scriptorium of the Leiden monastery
Lopsen, where Aurelius lived and worked at that time. In any case we
know with certainty that the Vita Jheronimi is not an autograph, because
we know the handwriting of Aurelius from examples in the Vulcanius
collection presently at Leiden.³

³ On the Vulcanius MSS, containing autographs of Aurelius see my thesis, p. 54,
pp. 198-200. Aurelius kept his own copy of the Vita Jheronimi as appears from the
legacy of his books to his friendJohannes Theodericus Harius in 1531: M. E. Kronen-
berg, “Werken van Cornelius Aurelius (Donkanus) in de bibliotheek van kanunnik Mr.
Jan Dirksz. van der Haer (anno 1531)‚‘’ Het Boek XXXVI (1963-1964), p. 76, nr 6.
Most probably the copy was made in Deventer, and not in the scriptorium of beiden,
as appears from the marginal glosses.
