60 LATIN IN 16TH-CENTURY DANISH CULTURE

At the end of the preceding century Conrad Celtis had declared that the
centre of the world had moved northwards to Germany, and now the
Danish poets were trying‚ if not to move the centre, then at least to
expand the boundaries of civilisation further northwards.

The Language of Eternity

The ideological status of Latin was not only linked with its being the
international language, but also with its function as the language common
to all epochs. In Latin you could read the wisdom of classical antiquity,
and you could speak to coming generations.²³ Since Latin is the language
of eternity‚ by describing persons, events, or localities in Latin poems you
render them immortal. Not least in areas peripheral to the mainstreams of
culture, this consideration carried enormous weight. Through their Latin
poems, Danish poets struggled to gain a place for their nation’s history
and geography not only on the map of Europe, but on that of eternity.
This also applies to Jorgen Rosenkrantz' epitaph. The poem’s main
theme is immortality as against transience. Everythi ng human is transitory,
but belief in the resurrection of the flesh brings with it the prospect of
individual eternity. In the meantime, however, earthly glory should not be
disregarded either. While the passport to heavenly immortality was
Christ's book, enrolling for worldly eternity might seem a more complicat-
ed affair. How did you make sure that you were properly registered?
Just as in more mundane matters poets and patrons had to consider
various media before making their choice, there were many ways in which
to register for glory.Jorgen Rosenkrantz chose to have his name written
in various languages and more than one system of writing. He had his
poem composed in both Latin and Danish, written in Roman and Gothic
letters. He had the text surrounded with his ancestral coats of arms, a
“language” that guaranteed the kind of immortality that goes with the
lineage. He had his and his family's portraits painted, thus preserving their

Brahe: “Elegy to Urania” in De nova stella (Copenhagenz Lorentz Benedicht 1573). Cf.
