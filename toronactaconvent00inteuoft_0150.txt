l32 ERASMUS ΟΝ THE EPISTLE To THE ROMANS

561C on Rom. 1:12). Erasmus comments on the artfulness: “This is pious
cunning and, so to speak, holy flattery” (561D). Again in 1527 Erasmus
supports a reading (adopted in 1516) of Rom. 829 by observing that Paul
would address his readers with gentleness; harsher remarks would be
directed to others (“si tamen'’ 601E). In 1535 he defends the indicative in
Rom. 5:1 (“We have peace'') noting that the indicative offers a form of
admonition that suits Paul’s modesty and civility. This, too, is a familiar
“figure”—to use the indicative to express what we wish to be done. The
modestia of the Apostle is a matter of considerable concern for Erasmus,
particularly in 1535. On the one hand his modestia, clearly defined, might
well serve as a model for contemporary bishops; on the other hand it had
relevance to the tone of Paul’s letter, to the authority of the writer and the
response of the reader. Consequently, in this edition, Erasmus added to
his comments on Rom. 15:17-23 what is perhaps his most striking state-
ment of the Apostle’s modestia. Once more recalling Chrysostom‚ he notes
that the Apostle established his authority not by episcopal insignia but by
a telling account of the great deeds performed through the Spirit: “Of
these he arrogates none to himself, but gives all the glory to God, a man
boasting with the greatest modesty, and modest in his vaunting, proud in
Christ, humble in himself ’ (“prodigiorum” 64813). Thus one observes
through the five editions of the Annotations a steadily growing emphasis
upon the Apostle's literary skill in attempting to control the response of
his audience.

II. The Analysis of Scyle

Erasmus' sensitivity to the literary qualities of the Greek text of Romans
finds expression in persistent efforts to call attention to style in the
Epistle. I wish here to consider primarily (1) the chief forms his stylistic
criticism took and (2) the changing character of his criticism from the
early (1516, 1519) to the late (1527, 1535) editions.

In the first two editions, Erasmus' most persistent interest in Paul's style
arises from the pleasure he believes it brings. He is, moreover‚ primarily
interested in the pleasant effect of similar sounds in associated words.
“There is a delightful relationship [festiva affinitas] in ἑδοκῑμασαν and
ἁδόκιμον” (“in reprobrum'’ 566D [1516] on Rom. 1:28); “To those who
read Greek there is a not unpleasing relationship [non ingrata affinitas] in
πορνεῖα and πονηρῖα” (“nequz'tia’' 566F [1519] on Rom. 1:29); “Itis true

that in decus-dedecus the pleasure [iucunditas] of the figure [i.e., in the
Greek τιμὴν καῖ ἁτιμῑαν is rendered” (“aliud'' 614F [1516] on Rom.
