johannes Murmellius' Scoparius (1517-18).·
Another German Defense os Humanistic Study

JAMEs v. MEHL

D uring the 1975 Tours Colloque,Joel Lefebvre identified Strasbourg‚
Cologne, and Vienna as “centres de gravite” in the development of
German humanism.¹ His argument was based on the appearance of a
number of defenses of poetry by German humanists, published in those
cities between about 1460 and 1520. That series of defenses, according to
Lefebvre, culminated in 1518 with the publication of works by several
leading humanists: Hermann von dem Busche’s Vallum humanitatis,
Johannes Murmellius‘ Scoparius, and Joachim Vadianus' De poetica et
carminis ratione. Vadianus’ De poetica has already been treated by Peter
Schaffer.² During the last congress of this association‚ I attempted to
interpret Busche's Vallum humanitatis.³ I should now like to turn my
attention to Murmellius' Scoparius.

Pn'or to the brief analysis of the Scoparius by Lefebvre,⁴ only short
accounts of Murmellius’ last major work could be found in the older
Murmellius biography of Reichling and in the biographical articles by

ι,ΙοέΙ Lefebvre, “Le poete, la poesie et la poetique: Elements pour une definition
ct pour une datation de l’humanisme allemand,” in L'Humanisme allemand (1480-
1540): XVIIIe Collaque inter-national de Toum, ed. Joel Lefebvre and Jean-Claude
Margolin (Mfinchenz Fink3 Paris: Vrin, 1979), 285-301, here 285.
