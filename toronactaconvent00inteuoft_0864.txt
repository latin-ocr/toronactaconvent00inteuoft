838 THE LATIN POEMS or TYCHo BRAHE

the foolish. From the one will arise the love for the other.‘’

Si non vis solidum, stolidum secteris amorem,
In stolido solidi surget amoris AMOR.

(vv. 85-86)

On the surface a complete reversal of the poem’s idea, but seen in the
light of the philosophy of love a natural consequence: divine love is an
urge towards divine beauty, while earthly love is an urge towards the
earthly reflections of divine beauty. Therefore divine love can be obtained
through earthly love.

The change in Tycho’s handling of this picture of science from the
elegy to Urania to this poem is significant. The first elegy, with its self-
righteous tone, reflected the awkward position of a nobleman wanting to
be a scientist. The detached, playful poem for Erik Lange, on the other
hand, reflects a sophisticated minen, where the ideal of the literate noble—
man has come to be taken very earnestly. A scientific miniature court,
where Tycho and his nobleman friends played with fashionable philoso-
phy, and (as we know from other poems and letters)¹² called each other
mythological names.

For the study of these aspects of Tycho Brahe and his activities the
Latin poems constitute an important, and hitherto largely unused source
maten'al.

omnia, 9:324-26), and are used in several letters, e.g., Opera omnia, 7:321, 14:157-59,
