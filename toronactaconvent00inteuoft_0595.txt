Rotterdam, with Francois Rabelais and Christopher Longolius have since
been studied in some depth; yet little has been said of his numerous other
connections with prominent educators, statesmen‚ clergymen or military
leaders versed in the urbanities of humanist learning. A modern critical
edition of de Pins’ persona] correspondence would therefore represent a
significant contribution to the study of the early years of humanism in
Southern France. New information concerning known public figures
would come to light; more obscure individuals would be called to the
attention of specialists and provide new avenues for research.

Yet the question remains as to where this mysterious collection of let-
ters now is. Germain de La Faille, a seventeenth-century historian of
Toulouse, is said to have possessed it at one time.⁸ The last person known
to have consulted it was the highly industrious literary historian of Nimes,
Francis Graverol. In March of 1691, he had obtained permission from the
owners of the manuscript to transcribe a rather large portion of the let-
ters. That is the last time any qualified mention has been made of the
original, which seems to have disappeared towards the end of the seven-
teenth century.

Due to the unfortunate loss of the original, the Graverol manuscript,
now preserved in the Municipal Library of Nimes (Ms. 215), has become
all (the more important, as it is the only remaining collection of de Pins'
Latin correspondence known to exist. The Graverol transcriptiom had it
come to his attention, would certainly have provided valuable insight to L.
Thuasne, who has linked our author to Rabelais and Erasmus? The cor·
respondence has only come into use since its initial discovery by John L.
Gerig, who in turn passed his knowledge on to preserved Smith¹⁰ and P.
S. Allen.¹¹ Subsequent studies by count Jean de Pins,¹² a descendant of
