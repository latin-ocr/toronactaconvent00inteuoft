be questioned, and one must be impressed by the increasing openness
during the Renaissance of the text to interpretation and use.¹² Thus, to
take a single example, but one fundamental to the history of biography,
Thomas More’s Life osRichard III: Richard Sylvester has analysed More's
use of Sallust, Suetonius and Tacitus for the understanding and presenting
of character, and 1 need not remind this group of the brilliant demonstra-
tion in his introduction to More’s Life of the many-sidedness of the work.
For Sylvester penetratingly commented on the numerous borrowings and
imitations‚ analogues and allusions, and he succeeds in making it possible
for the twenu‘eth-century student to understand the process of fusing the
disparate elements into a single biography.

The full story of the classical tradition of biography during the Renais-
sance has yet to be written, although Bietenholz has written well on
Erasmus and biography; but the reading and teaching of biography during
the Renaissance must include not only the basic texts of Plutarch, Sueto-
nius, Sallust, Tacitus, and others, it must also study commentaries on
those texts. We know what was read; we need to know more about how it
was read, and taught, and imitated.

Here, there is time to take up only one classical example and to sketch
the availability of some of the resources of which 1 have been speaking,
and 1 propose to take Plutarch's Lives and to suggest some of the prefaces
and commentaries that were available to sixteenth-century writers of
biography. Many of More’s friends and acquaintances were in fact en-
gaged in translating Plutarch,¹³ including Erasmus, whose opuscula Plu-
tarchi nuper traducta. Erasmo interprete, was printed in 1512 and frequently
reprinted. Other Plutarchan works followed.

Early in the fifteenth century Leonardo Bruni had translated a number
of the lives, and shortly afterwards Guarino da Verona added Latin
translations of fifteen more. Later in the century Francesco Filelfo pub-
lished four Latin translations, and then in a Rome edition of 1470 Cam-
pano presented a Latin translation of all of the lives.Just as Plato—at much
