other passage in Paul‚'' he says, “is bettered ordered and, so to speak,
pidumtiost’ (637c-D), and he proceeds to identify phrase and period,
repetition, conti-asts, the sound effects of words, and concludes that no
song could be jucundior. Analysis in this mode is not reserved only for the
passages Augustine had cited in the De doctrina christiana: by 1527 it had
apparently become an established technique for the reading of this
Epistle, as a 1527 addition to an annotation on Rom. 2:12 witnesses,
where Erasmus notes that the entire verse has become picturatus by the
repetition of words and by the set of opposites, and modulatus by the
rhythm of the phrases (“sine lege peccaverunt'’ 571D).

From the first edition of the New Testament, Erasmus endeavored to
demonstrate that Paul's letter to the Romans, in the original Greek, was a
work of considerable artistry. His annotations attempt to reveal‚ on the
one hand, the author of the letter shaping his work to win the approval of
his readers and, on the other, the literary qualities that convey pleasure in
the reading of scripture, and generate a sense of forcefulness in the text.
So much we might expect from the humanist and philologian. It is,
perhaps, more surprising to discover that as Erasmus became embattled
in theological controversy subsequent to his first edition, his commitment
to a literary reading of the Bible did not fade; on the contrary, the evi-
dence of this study indicates that the fourth edition of the Annotatjons in
1527 was a landmark in the articulation of the nature of the stylistic
power-as well as the beauty—of the epistle to the Romans, and that the
final edition offered some of his most pungent comments on the Apostle’s
effort to control the response of his audience.
