214 FACTION VERSUS FICTION

vernacular text the term fingere. But in the case of the Latin version the
situation was more complicated. In the ancient writers on the visual arts
he would find no justification whatsoever for using the same term. So he
made his choice, a little deliberately, so it seems, from the stock of ancient
vocabulary, already familiar to the new audience that he intended to
reach, no doubt, by the Latin version of his treatise: mainly the humanisti-
cally educated courtiers and scliolars outside Florence, to whose delight
also the above-mentioned interpolations were made, accordingly. De
Pictura was dedicated, in fact, to the Duke of Mantua, Gian Francesco
Gonzago.¹³

Yet, Alberti must have realized that the idea of imitation was not fully
consistent with his new concept of pictorial art. In his treatise he repeated-
ly reminds the reader that what he sets down on its pages is not parroting
the teachings of the Ancients‚ but his own genuine discoveries. At the end
of the first book, in particular in paragraph 21, he is eager to stress that
as far as the composition of the picture is concerned, to which belongs,
not least, its perspective construction, it was a field totally unknown in
Antiquity.¹‘¹

But perhaps Alberti was right, all the same, in moderating his radical-
ism, trying instead to follow the literary standards and terminological
precepts of the authors preferred by his fellow-humanists. The following
observation may provide an indication in this direction.

When, shortly after the middle of the century, the non-Florentine
humanists, such as Cyriacus of Ancona and Bartholomeo Fazio, were
searching among the works of art produced by their contemporaries to
find some suitable pretence for their own exercise of the ancient rhetori-
cal genre of ekphrasis or art description, their eyes fell, characteristically
enough, not on the multitude of Italian pictures‚ but on the few ones
brought into the peninsula from Flanders. In the detail-realism or genre—
paintings, executed in the magic oil technique by the two Netherlandish
masters,Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden, the humanists seem to
have recognised the kind of surface illusion described to them by the
Roman authors, for which reason they could, conveniently, use them as
their models. And they did so, without questioning how far the reality,
represented in the altar-pieces and the devotional pictures of transalpine
provenance‚ was identical with that depicted for instance in the still-life of
the Roman wall decoration.¹⁵ Consequently, in their descriptions, they
