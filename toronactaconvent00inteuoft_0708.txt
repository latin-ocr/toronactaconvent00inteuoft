682 LATIN TERMS AND THEIR TRANSLATION

carried overtones of a particular kind of government whose model was the
classical city. If then a twentieth century translator chooses to render
civitas as “civil society,'' he should be aware that he is implicitly locating
his author in a certain political tradition.

None of this is relevant, however, to the translation of Pufendorf. Born
near Leipzig in 1631, he spent his life at the courts of German princes and
at the royal court of Sweden. To render civitas in Pufendorf’s De Officio,
published at Lund in 1673, Ι have thought it appropriate to use the word
“state.” It was first noticed in 1677 that the German word Staat was being
employed in the sense of Italian stato, French estat and Dutch staat and
that the word had a connection with absolutism; the word Staatsmann as
homme d’e‘tat is also first noticed at this time.¹⁷ Pufendorfs political doc-
trine is clearly in support of absolutism; and in one of his latest writings,
De habitu Christianae religionis (Breme 1687), he does in fact consistently
employ the word status for “state,'’ as if he had seen the difficulty of using
the tainted civitas (which he had used throughout De Officio) and had gone
back to the Latin root of estat and stato to express his meaning.¹⁸ When,
finally, Barbeyrac translated De Officio into French, which unlike English,
by this date (1707) had long had e'tat in common usage, he included it
among his options for translation of civitas, along with societe‘ civile and
corps politique.

One may illustrate the tensions set up by the different traditions by
comparing a van'ety of translations of a crucial passage. At. 2.6.6 a civitas
(as a potestas . . . quae omnibus sit metuenda) is said to come into being only
when men have united their wills and strengths by conferring them upon
one man or assembly of men. Ubi autem et voluntatum et virium unio sacta
suerit, tunc demum multitudo hominum in validissimum corpus, civitatem
nimirum, animatur. Tooke translates “And when there is a union made of
their wills and forces, then this multitude of men may be said to be
animated and incorporated into a firm and lasting society'' (293). Tooke
here gives “society'' (not even “civil society’') for civitas. Barbeyrac, by

“stam” and “Staatsmann.‘' Cf. also K. H. F. Dyson, The State Tradition in Westem
Europe (Oxford, 1980) 27, “its political use during the seventeenth century developed
under French and Dutch inssuence.” Pufendorf rarely uses societas civilis and then
always in a sense having to do with society rather than with state.

constat, homines, animadversis vitae segregis incommodis atque periculis, quaerendae
securitatis causa inter se convenisse super sua in unam societatem conjunctione.
