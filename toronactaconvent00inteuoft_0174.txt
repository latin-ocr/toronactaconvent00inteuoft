154 ERASMUS' OPUS DE CONSCRIBENDIS EPISTOLIS

returned to the work reluctantly. How extensively he revised at this time
we cannot be certain because Despauterius' selections offer no firm basis
for comparison. Erasmus may well have expanded Section B as he worked
with Colet on the curriculum of St. Paul’s in 1511. If we compare the Opus
de conscribendis epistolis with the Libellus, we can see that by 1522 he had
greatly expanded Section D, adding a classification of letters taken from
the Typoi epistolikoi of pseudo-Demetrius, enlarging his advice on develop-
ing arguments, and citing scores of new illustrations. Probably this materi-
al, like such collections as the Adagia, was accumulated over many years.
As Jolidon (1973 Acta) and Charles Fantazzi (CWE 25:2-9) have shown, in
revising the Libellus, Erasmus removed personal references and replaced
model letters that may have seemed too frivolous or outspoken. He
developed this circumspectiori after 1506, probably after his own New
Testament of 1516 and Luther’s Ninety-Five Theses of 1517 had heated
the intellectual climate. From the earlier version that Despauterius had
seen, Erasmus removed an excessively virulent address to theologians who
insist on the title magister noster. Nevertheless‚ he retained the Encomium
matrimonii in the authorized edition even though it had come under attack
at Louvain. Margolin has shown that in his final revisions of 1534, which
focused on this sample letter of persuasion, Erasmus qualified his criti-
cisms of monasticism and celibacy while otherwise strengthening his
argument (ASD I-2tl96-97).

In revising the opus de conscribendis epistolis in 1522 and 1534, Erasmus
perhaps expanded his argument, improved his style, chastened his wit,
objectified his tone, and tempered his satire, but he did not fundamentally
change his thought. Examination of the pirated Libellus and Formula and
of Despauterius' citations in his Syntaxis suggests that by 1499 Erasmus
had thoroughly assimilated Italian humanism. Reading the correspondence
of Angelo Poliziano about 1500, he became alarmed by the development
of humanism toward extreme neo-classicism. He found Poliziano a conge-
nial model, approving his eclecticism and his distaste for Ciceronianism,
and was spurred by his inssuence to a critical reassessment of his Italian
contemporaries. Before he crossed the Alps in 1506, this process of
reassessment had led Erasmus to that complex but common sense balance
of nature, art, and imitation that characterizes his mature thought. His
experiences in Italy only confirmed his conviction that the humanist too
intent on imitating the classical world would be unable to contribute to his
own.
