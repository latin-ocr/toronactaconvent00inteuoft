CHARLES FANTAZZI 141

Cathedral Library of Vercelli, great impetus was given to the classical style
in letter-writing. As early as 1419 the letters of Cicero became part of the
school curriculum in the school of Guarino Guarini in Verona. They must
certainly have been included among the texts of Cicero that Barzizza
taught in Padua.

1 should like first to give a general description of the format and
themes of the letters and then examine cursorily their stylistic qualities.
Barzizza employs a elever didactic device in arranging the imaginary letters
in the form of an epistolary exchange. In this way he provides the student
with van’ous ways of expressing the same thought, since the respondent, es-
pecially at the beginning of the letter, will make reference to matters
broached by his correspondent. A similar method is found in a scholasu'c
exercise written under his direction in 1410 by Nicola Contan'ni and Frances—
co Barbaro, in which there is free discussion between pupil and teacher.⁹

The central theme of the letters is that of friendship in all its ramifica-
tions, with particular emphasis on the conflict between personal interests
and the state, the protection of a friend's reputation against calumny and
slander‚ and the duties of loyalty. Such sentiments are to be found fre-
quently in the letters of Cicero, aS‚ for example, in the well-known corre-
spondence with Gaius Matius, the friend of Caesar, and in Petrarch. The
very first exchange concerns the casting aside of an old acquaintance, who
is given the generic name of Sempronius. The writer implores that his
action will be interpreted in the correct light, confident that his friend will
defend him. The respondent promises his fidelity but cautions that it is
hard to eradicate an opinion once it has taken root. In the first five sets of
letters that aspect of the duties of friendship which involves the conflict
between private loyalties and the interests of the state is a dominant
theme. In one exchange of letters the subject is the abandonment of a
friend’s legal defense in deference to the prestige of the republic. Law and
equity, a dichotomy much debated in the Roman schools of declamafion,
prevail over private concerns. In another pair of letters the discussion rises
to the more politically dangerous subject of the loss of the freedom of
speech that existed in the old days of the republic, since there is now no
leader who really has the concerns of the state at heart. Once again it is
the sear of personal loss (discrimen rerum suarum, Furietti, p. 229) that is
pitted against the higher interests of the state.

A conspicuous portion of the letters has to do with the friend's keeping
