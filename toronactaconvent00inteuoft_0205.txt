psalms, translations of theological tracts‚ moral treatises and prayer books
from German and French into Danish. Outside the Christian literature we
find occasional poetry and genealogies. And finally, there are rarities like
a novel, an autobiography, a polyglot collection of poeuy, a tragedy, and
a treatise on moral philosophy. From the eighteenth century the number
of genres becomes more varied and less bound to religion, and we find
comedies, letters, epistolary novels, diaries, autobiographies, cookbooks,
and experiments with small poems in new reworkings of the European
genres: Anacreontic poetry‚ heroids, etc.

The women whom we know were familiar with Latin seem to have
shown very little interest in writing in Latin. They used their knowledge to
read and learn and to teach. In their own poems, several of them have
also drawn inspiration and motifs from the classical authors. ln two
instances we know that they used them for translations. In the 1670s‚
Anna Margrethe Quitzow translated the first three books of Caesar’s
Gallie Wars. Her translation was never published, however. And from the
hand of our most learned woman, Birgitte Thott, we have a translation of
Seneca.

Birgitte Thott

Instead of listing the names of a number of our most famous women, 1
will single out one individual‚ not a typical one, but a worthy representa·
tive of the Scandinavian learned women—the Danish noblewoman‚ Birgi tte
Thott, who lived from 1610 to 1662? Her major work stems from her
period as a childless widow: a translation of Seneca’s Philosophus, printed
in 1658. Already at the time of her youth she was referred to as a budding
Danish Anna Maria van Schurman. The first of the book’s introductory
Latin panegyric poems is, in fact, written by Anna Maria van Schurman.
Here she refers to her Danish colleague as the tenth Muse of the North.
Birgitte Thott’s Seneca translation was the first complete translation of a

it was a work of literary prose written in the vernacular.¹⁰ Prose litera-
