The Teminological Puzzle

in Albertz· 's Treatise οη Painting

Some people, with a gift for serendipity, stumble upon bright new
ideas without being aware of their novelty. The princeps of the

Italian humanists of the early Renaissance, Leon Battista Alberti, however,
was not that kind of man; on the contrary, if we take a look at his writings
on art theory, at least, he always seems keenly aware of his innovations,
judging from his open or disguised criticism and polemics against his
predecessors or contemporaries of a more conservative observation. It is
the more surprising, therefore, that in his treatise on painting, written in
his—and the century's-thirties‚ he appears to have made a backward step
in his thinking from its first Italian version, Della Pittura, which 1 am
inclined to date to 1436, to the Latin version, De Pictura, dating presum-
ably from about 1440} But it may be possible to find a plausible explana-
tion for this. A suggestion would be that the humanist literary tradition as
well as the Latin writers on the visual arts, offer-ing themselves as the

¹ The true versions of the texts are given simultaneously in Leon Battista Alberti
Opere Volgum· vol. 1, ed. Cecil Grayson (Bari, 1973). There has been some discussion
as to the dating of the two versions. But to me it seems likely that the Italian one was
inspired by his fresh encounter with the marvels of Florentine art in the years
immediately after his first visit to the city in 1428, whereas the Latin version would be
nicely accounted for by his wish to leave the city in the late thirties.
