l92 THE POLITICS OF IRENICISM

good when Paleario was eventually executed for heresy in 1570. Did
Sadoleto know something, or was he naive? Of other contn'butors to the
volume Flaminio died in his bed in 1550, ironically enough attended by
Cardinal Caraffa, the chief Inquisitor, who happened to be passing when
the viaticum was borne in; as Pope Paul IV Caraffa would later declare
that he wished he could dig up Flaminio's body and burn it.⁶ There is no
evidence that Flaminio was a deliberate heretic or Nicodemite (in Calvin’s
term) but recent opinion strongly supports his role as the dominant voice
behind the notorious Beneficio di Giesu Cristo which was condemned in the
mid-1540’s. So, even if we disregard Oporinus‘s transalpine additions-Ca-
stellio and Wilson—the Italians of Sadoleto's choice represent enough
ambivalence to set a few pyres smouldering. Which brings me back to the
question: was Sadoleto naive or conniving? Surely the answer must be
neither. Both the letters that 1 have mentioned, that of Sadoleto to Gryph—
ius and its echo in that of Sphinter to Oporinus, alert us to a series of
related concerns. At their centre is the ideal of Christian eloquence or
what we can term theologia rhetorica; this had been a feature of humanist
activity since Petrarch, adapting the classical arts of persuasion to the
urgent pastoral needs of a church in decline. Sadoleto would surely
endorse Horace’s claim,

Non satis est pulchra esse poemata; dulci sunto
et quocumque volent animum auditoris agunto.

‘Tis not enough, th’elaborate Muse affords
Her poems beautie, but a sweet delight
To worke the hearers minds, still, to their plight.⁷

If there is a single defining feature of humanism it is that rhetorical
concern with the affective rather than the definitive function of language;
hence the desire for an authentic imitatio, one that might recapture the
force of classica! Latinity and utilise it in the service of Christian spirituali-
ty. But a further point follows: the association of this theologia rhetorica
with a tendency to minimise the problems of confessional difference.
Language which is apt, in Sadoleto’s phrase, “animos incendere’' is not
easily reconciled with scholastic precision. The consequences of this can
be traced in the scattered irenical episodes characteristic of humanism
