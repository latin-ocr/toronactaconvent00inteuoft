JAMEs v. Minu„ 475

Aristotle had used the story as a way to encourage his readers to continue
their investigation of his biological work, so too was Murmellius prompt-
ing his former colleagues (and the reader) to consider carefully his own
study of the humaniora.

Murmellius sustained his analogy of the scoparius, the broom, in the
very organizau‘on and format of his text. As the broom is a binding
together of individual pieces of reed, he brought together some 131
different selections, or chapters, in his collection. The pieces vary widely
in their subject, authorship, purpose, and length. Again, limits of time
preclude a more detailed summary of the contents of each selectiom in
any case, Bomer has already provided such a summary.²l Rather I would
like to refine certain groupings of the selections, already suggested in part
by B6mer, as a means of clarifying Murmellius’ argument in the Scoparius.
In a sense, the Scopmius was a fasciculus, a collection of “bundles” of
documents bound together and then interwoven to form a useful tool, a
broom, to promote humanistic reform of education.

These “bundles,'’ or groupings, are only suggested by Murmellius in
periodic headings and brief commentaries in the Scoparius. My efforts here
to identify and to interpret those themes should likewise be viewed as
suggestive. Each of the six groups or categories that Ι have listed below is
characterized by a specific criticism or attack against certain “defenders of
barbarism and enemies of humanism,‘’ referred to in the book's title. At
the same time, Murmellius usually included selections and references for
correction or reform of those abuses.

Group 1: Against Alexander de Villa Dei and the glossators of his medieval
grammar (Nos. 1-31 in the Bomer ed.).

Group 11: Against scholastic theologiam, to be corrected by cultivating a
biblical humanism (Nos. 32-50).

Group 111: Againstjurists and those grammarians that support them, to be
corrected by reading purified pagan and Christian classics, along with
appropriate humanist commentaries (Nos. 51-62).

Group IV: Against those who misuse and corrupt Latin and Greek gram-
mar (Nos. 63-84).

Group V: Against sophists and dialecticians (Nos. 85-122).

Group VI: Against unlearned clerics, to be corrected by a return to the
humanistic study of language and literature (Nos. 123-131).
