Erasmus on the Epistle to the Romans:
A “Literavy'' Reading

ROBERT SIDER

l n both the Methodus (1516) and the Ratio (1518, 1519) Erasmus
stressed the importance of reading the Bible with an appreciation of its
“literary’' qualities. In the Methodus he asserted that the Bible has a closer
affinity with poetry than with philosophy (Holborn, 155).l A proper
reading of the Bible should transform the reader (Holborn, l5l); but it is
from literary artistry that one derives a pleasure which helps to make the
written word effective. Thus in a 1520 addition to the Ratio Erasmus notes
that as a result of figures the scriptures enter our minds with greater
delight and force (Holborn, 272). It is one of the tasks of the interpreter,
therefore, to bring out the force of the figures. It is my purpose in this
essay to consider how, in the Annotations‚ Erasmus himself read the
Biblical text as a literary artifact.

For his own exposition of the literary art of scripture Erasmus began
from the perspectives of grammar and rhetoric, and relied upon the
techniques and the vocabulary appropriate to these disciplines. Though
Jacques Chomarat has in a general way shown the presence of these
grammatical and rhetorical terms in Erasmus’ Annotations,² a more
precise assessment of Erasmus’ efforts towards a literary reading of the

Bible can emerge only if we are attentive to two features of his exposition
