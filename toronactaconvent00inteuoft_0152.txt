134 ERASMUS oN THE EPISTLE το THE ROMANS

continued in 1519, that ἔχθρα was better read as a noun than an adjective
because it is “more effective and more in keeping with the style of Paul'’
(“inimica” 6010E).

The annotations on five passages, Rom. 5:3-5‚ 8:29-39, 12:6-21,
13:8-9‚ and 13:12-14, became in the 1527 edition a tour de force of stylistic
analysis. All of them have counterparts in Augustine's De doctrina chris-
ἰίαηα,8 and it is clear from Erasmus' specific reference to the Doctrina that
they all have their genesis in that great work. Already in 1519 Erasmus
had cited the Doctrina in a brief discussion of the two passages from
Romans 13. The 1527 edition, however, marks a major development not
only in the extension of the analysis to the other passages in Romans
which Augustine had cited to illustrate style, but also in the nature of the
analysis, particularly in chapters 8, 12 and 13.

Augustine had cited these passages primarily to illustrate the middle
and the high styleS, the passages from chapters 12 and 13 illustrating the
former, that from chapter 8 the latter. Augustine for the most part simply
quoted the passages, though he occasionally noted in passing the graceful
arrangement of cola and commata in the rhythm, and in 4.20.42 he
observes briessy that in the grand style force of expression is not depen-
dent for its effect upon the various adornments of style, though in fact
they are usually present.

Erasmus takes up the pen at the point where Augustine had put it
down. He accepts, for example, Augustine's characterization of Rom.
8:29-39 as a passage in the grand style where force and pleasure are
combined. He proceeds, however, to show precisely where the force,
where the pleasure lies; and he employs the technical language of rhetoric
to do so—a feature we have already observed especially characteristic of
the 1527 edition. He notes the pleasure (iucunditas) in the gradatio of
verses 29-30: forekneW, foreordained, called, justified, glorified; in the
sound effects of words (cadentia, desinentia); in repetition (traductio); in
opposites such as life-death, things present-things to come. He finds the
force (δεῑνωσις) of the passage in the phrasing (comparia), the asyndeta,
and, above all, in the questions (interrogatio and percontatio—identified
elsewhere, as we have seen, in the 1527 edition as contributing to ac-
rimonia and vehementia) (608C-D). Likewise in commenting on Rom.
12:6-21 he accepts Augustine’s judgment that the passage illustrates the
middle style, but Erasmus goes on to reveal its beauties. “Scarcely any
