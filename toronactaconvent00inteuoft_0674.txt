650 LA DANSE MACABRE AND DRURY's MORs COMOEDIA

due to its being both safe in the Spanish Catholic Netherlands and conve-
niently close to the Channel coast. Allen's foundation, the first in North-
ern Europe after the Tridentine Council, was intended and proved suc-
cessful as a seminarium, a “seed-bed,'’ for English priests. Douay also
became the most important publishing centre for those books of piety and
religious controversy which were proscribed in England, and it was at
Douay that the Catholic English version of the Old Testament was printed
in two volumes between 1609 and 1611. Having about some 80 students
per year reading the humanities‚ the English College nourished most of
the future English bishops, many famous writers,²⁵ and some outstanding
Catholic laymen.²⁶ In fact, the preservation of the Catholic faith in Eng-
land was largely due to Douay College.

Mors Comoedia

Drury’s comedy Mors was apparently written in 1618. The Douay Diaries
give an account of the first performances on January 8 and 11, 1619:

1619 Januarius Die g. Comoediam2⁷ a Domino Gulielmo Druraeo
compositam scolares privatim in refectorio egerunt, quae spectatori-
bus adeo placuit, ut fama ejusdem per civitatem ab iisdem dissemi-
nata aliqui iique ex precipuis Magistratus, nomine aliorum per alios
ad Reverendum Dominum Presidem²⁸ supplicarunt, ut iterum
curaret exhiberi. Quorum votis annuit Reverendus Dominus Praeses;
unde 11⁶ huius mensis scolares nostri eandem publice etiam sub dio
(quia loci prioris angustia omnium votis minime satisfecisset) maiori
cum alacritate ac applausu exhibuerunt; unde unus magistratuum
qui praesens aderat aliquot vini totas nomine aliorum actoribus ipsis
est elargitus.²⁹

A manuscript of Mors seems not extant. It was printed thrice, first in
1620,²''0 with Latin encomia by George Leyburne, Thomas Blackloe,

²⁵ Among them Harding, stapleton, Sanders, Reynolds and Campion.

²⁷ The name of the comedy is not mentioned here; since two of Drury’s three plays
are tragi-comedies‚ the entry may well refer to Mors Comoedia. 1 gratefully acknowledge
