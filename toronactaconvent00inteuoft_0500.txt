476 JOHANNES MURMELLIUS’ SCOPARIUS

These themes are intertwined and supported by each other. Murmellius
reinforces his textual unity in a concrete way by taking different selections

from a single source and placing them, as appropriate, through the entire
work.

In keeping with his earlier interests as a humanist teacher and author,
Murmellius directed his main attack against those who continued to treat
Latin and Greek as medieval languages, that is, as scholastic corruptions
of the original classica} languages, Instruction in late medieval Latin was
based largely on the Doctrinale, which had been written in 1199 by the
French grammarian Alexander de Villa Dei.²² That popular Latin text-
book had undergone numerous revisions, including attempts to make it
compatible with the new humanistic way of learning.²³ Alexander had
used rhymed verses as a pedagogical method for students to remember
Latin vocabulary and grammatical rules. From the humanist perspective,
that approach not only trivialized linguistic study, but contributed to a
corruption of the Latin language itself.

In his critique of Alexander, Murmellius cited several of his own works,
including the Pappa puerorum, where he relied on the dialogue form as a
linguistic basis for learning Latin (19-25).24 His supporters in the attack
included a number of important fifteenth-century Italian educators and
grammarians: Sulpicius Verulanus (1), Aldus Manutius (2), Antonius Illumina-
tus (4), Mapheus Vegius (12-14), and Paolo Vergen'o (18). From the North
he referred to Rudolph Agricola (26) and Jacob Wimpfeling's [sidonem
Germanicus (3). As a corrective to Alexander, Murmellius quoted from the
first pages of Erasmus' De ratione studii (28), where it is recommended that
students should learn Greek before taking up Latin grammar.

Murmellius’ charge against the scholastic theologians was oblique rather
than direct. Nowhere did he mention those theologians, especially the
