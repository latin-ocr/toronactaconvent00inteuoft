678 LATIN TERMS AND THEIR TRANSLATION

The texts in question are Thomas Hobbes, De Cive (1642),2 Samuel
Pufendorf, De Officio Hominis et Civis (1673),³ and an extensive and influ-
ential commentary on the latter by Gershom Carmichael, regent and
professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow University, which was published
in 1724.ἰ

Pufendorf and Carmichael are consciously writing in a particular
tradition of natural law which they regarded as having been created in
reaction against scholastic natural law doctrine by Hugo Grotius. Car-
michael announces this intellectual debt in the preface to his commentary.
“This [moral] science had been most highly esteemed by the wisest of the
ancients who devoted themselves to its study with great care. It then lay
buried under debris together with almost all the other noble arts until a
little after the beginning of the last century when it was restored to more
than its pristine splendour . . . by the incomparable Hugo Grotius in his
outstanding work On the Laws os War and Peace. And from that time the
most erudite and celebrated scholars in Europe, as if aroused by the
sound of a trumpet, have vied with one another in the study of this
noblest and most useful branch of learning.”⁵ This school goes by the
name of the “natural jurisprudence” tradition.⁶

Despite Carmichael’s emphasis upon Grotius’s originality, Grotius was
clearly indebted (though the extent and nature of the debt is a matter of
controversy) to previous writers on natural law and particularly to Vas-
quez, Suarez, and other Catholic theologiam, chiefly in Spain, who in the

² An English translation of De Cive appeared in 1651 under the title Philosophical
Rudimenas Concerning Govemment and Society. Richard Tuck in his review of Howard
Warrender's edition of De Cive in Political Studies 33 (1985), 308-15 has given reasons
for thinking that most of this translation is not by Hobbes himself, as had always been
assumed.

³ My translation is due to appear in an edition of this work by Professor J. H.
Tully, McGill University, to be published by Cambridge University Press.
