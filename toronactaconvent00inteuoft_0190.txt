166 THE JEPHTHAH TRAGEmEs

In the following 1 shall try to concentrate on the texts and, consequent-
ly, to abstain from remarks on dramatic theory, from theological specula-
tions upon the Jephthah story in the Bible, and from historical observa-
tions about the religious beliefs of Buchanan, Vondel and their audiences
or readers. It may be useful, however, to point out in advance that there
are firmly established biblical keynotes from which no poet in the six-
teenth and seventeenth centuries could afford to deviate.

I call attention to four of these:

1. There is no doubt that the Bible looks upon human sacrifice with
the greatest revulsion.

2. It is a grave obligation to carry out what has been promised to
Go .

3. Tossronounce a “rash vow’' is a sin: a biblical form of hybris.

4. Jephthah is one of the great Judges, a saviour of Israel, and must
so be regarded as a noble hero.

As a consequence, the tragic tension is already part of the biblical story
itself; the poets did not have to invent it.² Ι shall now first characterize
Buchanan’s tragedy‚ then Vondel's and, finally, a Spinozistic perspective
on both dramas will be outlined.

In Buchanan's Iephthes we admire an ingenious balance of language,
structure and ideas. Yet this piece of literature is a mixture of highly
heterogeneous traditions: a biblical story and a biblical message as Bu-
chanan saw it, a Greek conception of tragedy‚ a Latin rhetorical-poetical
text incorporating a great variety of literary erudition.

The prologue functions in much the same way as in some Euripidean
dramas, which offers the poet the opportunity to state the biblical view on
the story, i.e., the tenor of the book of Judges, right at the beginning of
the play. Thus he can develop its actions and events against this biblical
background without admitting any intervention from outside into the
actions and decisions of the human characters More specificallszephthah
takes his vow and decides to sacrifice his daughter without any divine

Drama and the Humanisc Tradition (Leiden, New York, Copenhagen, Cologne, 1987).

¹ The imitatio-character of Vondel'sJeptha has been argued convincingly by W. A.
P. Smit, Van Pascha tot Noah . . . , 3 vols. (Zwolle‚ 1956-62), 2: 240-379. Smit has also
shown (2, 248-50) that Vondel was well acquainted with G. J. Vossius, De imitatione
(1547).

² On human sacrifice: Deut. 18:9-10; 12:31; 2 Kings 1623 etc.; on the obligation to
fulfil a vow: Deut. 23:21-33; on rash vows: Eccles. 5:1-6; on Jephthah: 1 Sam. 12:11;
Heb. 11:32.
