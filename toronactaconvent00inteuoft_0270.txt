246 THOMAS VINCENT'S PARIA

Would that some Oedipus might with his cleverness cross my path
ηοω. Here Ι understand nothing of all the things that people say to
me. Ι have gained a mother and a girlfriend‚ but have lost myself. I
am someone, Ι do not know who, called Archaicus; Ι left Milan a

Fulvius. (1952—59)

Shakespeare's Antipholus of Syracuse “to find a mother and a brother’'
loses himself in Ephesus (The Comedy os Errors l.2.39-40), while, as we
have just seen, Fulvius bewildered in Ancona laments: “I have gained a
mother and a girlfriend‚ but have lost myself'' (“Matrem atque amicam
lucrifeci, atque meipsum perdidi” [1956-57]; cf. The Comedy ofErrors
3.2.73-74 and Paria 3720, 4514). Moreover, Antipholus of Syracuse
wonders that he is greeted by all, “[a]s if Ι were their well-acquainted
friend, s And every one doth call me by my name” (The Comedy ofErrors
4.3.2-3)‚ while Fulvius is also mystified that he is saluted as a friend. But
all call him by the wrong name: “nemo erat s Quin familiarem se ingere-
ret, 8c falso nomine salutaret memoriter’' (4353-56). There is poignancy,
moreover‚ in Fulvius’s not knowing that his name is in truth neither
Archaicus nor Fulvius but Fulgentius. By contrast‚ Luchetti’s Fulvio has
always known that Virginio was his original name (H5v).

One final notice: whether Latin plays will ever make it into the Renais-
sance dramatic canon, Paria can participate in the radical revisioning of
the Renaissance called new historicism.³ The comedy subverts through
contradiction the dominant ideology which promises the royal audience a
successful resolution of social tension. For example, although he is, as
Archaicus points out, a rich merchant, Tiberius holds the traditional idea
that wealth is achieved by rapacious immorality. Thus he constitutes no
threat to the legitimacy of the gentny. Eleazer's punishment—an invitation
to dine on pork-is also a form of conversion, and so includes the exotic
neighbor who, undiscovered, has been pursuing his vicious, but not
undemanding, business for at least twenty years, without it seems achiev-
ing quick and easy wealth. Women as daughters are treated as inconven-
ient and potentially embarrassing property; but as a matron, as a proudly

³ Compare treatment of The Meo-cham os Venice, which offers to the cultural
materialist what Walter Cohen calls “an embarrassment of socio-economic riches”
(“The ΜενεΙιαηῑ of Venice and the Possibilities of Historical Criticism‚’' English Literavy
Histowy 49 [1982]: 765-89). More recendy, Thomas Moisan has interrogated the
reconciliations and mediations of the play in his “ ‘Which is the merchant here? and
which the Jew': subversion and recuperation in The Merchant of Venice,’' in Shahespeare
