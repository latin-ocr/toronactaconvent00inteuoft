JOYCE MONROE SIMMONS

Some works are lost inadvertently when they are destroyed or acci·
dentally hidden. Others are condemned to obscurity through
neglect as critical tastes change. Such was the fate of three early seven-
teenth-century commentaries on the epigrams of Martial. They had been
neglected since the late nineteenth century and have been ignored by all
subsequent commentators on Martial despite the recent resurgence of
interest in him. They are valuable for their help in assessing what Renais-
sance humanists thought about Martial and the genre epigram. This brief
description of the commentaries and their authors will serve to suggest
their value to students of the Renaissance.

Τὴε story of Martial in the Renaissance begins in antiquity. From the
first century A.D. we can trace an unbroken line of critical attention and
imitation, a line culminating in the editions and commentaries of the
Renaissance, the last great age of the epigram. Juvenal and Pliny the
Younger were influenced by him. Later, the works of the Church Fathers
display knowledge of Martial.¹ At the end of the fourth century Ausonius,
professor of rhetoric and poet, chose Martial as a model for imitation. In
seventh—century Spain, Martial appears in the Etymologiae of Isidore of
Seville.² During the Carolingian revival, while Martial was not so popular
