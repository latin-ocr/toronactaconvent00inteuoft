he made of More‘s own writings; and since he himself, taking for granted
his readers’ acquaintance with the fairly recent edition of More’s Opera
(Louvain, 1565; reissued 1566), quotes and translates more extensively
from The workes osSir Thomas More . . . wrytten by him in the Englysh longe
(London, 1557), 1 too will concentrate on that volume, his ubiquitous
English source.²

Stapleton was 22 and still at Oxford when the sturdy folio of More's
English Worhs, dedicated to Queen Mary by More’s nephew William
Rastell, was published on 30 April 1557. Via the English jesuit College at
Liege, Stapleton‘s copy made its way to the Bibliotheque Nationale in
Paris. It carries his signature in Latin, as well as the later location “Collegij
Anglicani Soc. Iesu Leod.” Several hands have marked the copy in several
inks, but Stapleton's marginalia and markings are the most numerous and
obvious.³

In Pico’s letter to his nephew Gianfrancesco, Stapleton seems to have
compared More’s English with the Latin original, for he completes the
meaningless sentence “that lest thei should begin to do yuel‘' (p. 15G) by
inserting after “thei’' the parenthesis: (leue to speak euyll, we sh.).The Life
qs John Picus bears no other mark; yet this one is witness enough of
attentive perusal.

In The Histovy os King Richani the Third, Stapleton marks the sentence
about Hastings (55G, lines 7-10); “when he most feared, he was in good
suerty: when he rekened him self surest‚ he lost his life, 8c that within two
howres after.” Opposite 5713, lines 9-11, he writes “Sapienter dic[tum],”
so that we can expect to find this in the special chapter devoted to More’s
“wise sayings” and indeed we do. More’s English is: “men vse if they haue
an euil turne, to wn'te it in marble: 8c whoso doth vs a good tourne, we
wn'te it in duste.'’ Stapleton seems to have consulted More's own Latin,
which he reproduces, only inverting the order of ‘siquid’ and ‘mali':
“Beneficia pulven', si quid mali patimur marmori insculpimus.” It is the
aptness of More’s comparison that he admires here, and the marginal
gloss “Simile'’ also punctuates his reading of More’s Four last Things. It
marks, among others, a passage concerning the depravation of man’s
“infected taste'’ (74C): “Like as a sick man feleth no swetenes in sugar, 8c

³ 1 shall ignore such details as the insertion of the preposition “of” after “maner”
in More's “no maner thyng” (sig. 02, El) precisely because the modernimtion this
implies seems to me posterior to stapleton: “no maner thyng’' was acceptable
throughout the Tudor period.
