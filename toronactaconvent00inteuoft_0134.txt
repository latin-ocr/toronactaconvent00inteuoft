116 ERASMUS oN METAPHoR

maiorem in modum delectavit stilus ille simplex et naturalis; verba
non ascita sed una cum ipsis sententiis cohaerentia3 sensus sani ac
solidi, nihil neque in verbis neque in sententiis aut portentosum aut
distortum aut coactum aut imminutum denique aut redundans.¹⁵

According to Erasmus, there is a neat conformity between word and thing
evident in Anthony’s writing. Like the classical rhetoricians, Erasmus holds
that words are signs for things, and that language mirrors the world,
although he does not examine systematically the relationship between
words and things, and at times is quite casual in his allusions to that
relationship.¹⁶ In saying here that the words altogether cohere with the
sententiae, Erasmus is assuming that he can entirely discern his friend's
thoughts from the words he has chosen. Such a judgment rests on an
assumption of common understanding of words, a community of dis-
course. The mirror reflects well, with the use of natural and simple
language; in the case of a distorting mirror, language could be monstrous,
unnatural‚ misshapen, twisted‚ forced, or strained.

Let us for a point of contrast turn to Erasmus's evaluation of another
correspondent, Guillaume Bude. In answering Bude’s request for a
judgment of his book, De Asse, Erasmus writes:

Iam animadverto te metaphoris ac parabolis impendio delectari,
quas habes plaerasque mire raras et insigniter argutas; sed quam
semel amplexus sis, ab ea vix unquam divelli potes: unde fit ut cum
totus sermo gemmeus sit potius quam gemmis distinctus, nonnihil
videatur a naturali simplicitate recedere.¹⁷

It is on the basis of metaphor that Erasmus criticizes Bude. Metaphor is a
gem, but when the sermo becomes gemmeus, completely covered with gems,
it ceases to be simple and natural—the virtues Erasmus has attributed to
Luxembourg's writi ng. The boundaries between what is proprium and what
is alienum have been violated. Thus, metaphor as a distinctive ornament is
permissible only if the sense of propriety—what is each word's “proper’'
place—remains.

¹⁶ For example, in De Copia Verborum ac Rerum, where one would most expect to
fmd such a discussion, he merely refers to the fact that although verbum and m are so
intimately connected that it would seem impossible to separate them, he has elected
to treat them separately here for pedagogical purposes. See LB Ι, 6Α.
