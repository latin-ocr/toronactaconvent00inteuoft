270 ENGELBERT KAEMPFER

tenfold increase in water it would not swell up, since the lower mass
immediately yields to the other flowing in, and from the common pressure
of the air, encircling the globe of the earth, the same height is always
maintained, which corresponds to the ocean and the common sphere of
all the land. You will object: the lake will already have become sweet, if for
as much sweet water it receives on the surface, it discharges an equal
quantity of salt water from the bottom into the ocean. I reply that the
same thing must be said to happen if the water flows out tumultuously
through whirlpools. In truth‚ there is no difficulty in either case, if the salt
streams flowing in and the roots of salt-laden mountains, which the waters
perennially wash, restore the loss. If indeed you will deny this, I have no
objection. In that case, we will again have a closed sea, no less so without
a connection with the ocean than without whirlpools through which the
sea may flow out; the latter of which we were obliged to demonstrate.
Meanwhile, lest our lake be overwhelmed by so many waters, we will
counter this flood with the dictum from chapter one of Ecclesiastes.
Speaking of the ocean, it says: All the rivers enter into the sea, and the sea does
not ovevflozm to the place from whence the rivers come, they retum so that they
may flow again. And in the case of the Caspian we will offer this judge-
ment: that it returns its own waters to the adjacent lands in the same
manner in which the ocean itself does, which, by Hercules, is burdened
with the rivers of all the rest of the globe. But how does it return them?
By what impetus are they driven? Or by a quasi-mechanical force of the
fluctuating ocean, are the fluids of its water driven upwards through the
openings of the earth, as if through siphons? Or by exhalation alone,
whether condensed through magnetic mud, which the distinguished
Becher observed, into little fountains‚ or condensed through the coldness
of the air into rain? The most wise King of mortals did not explain this
mystery of nature to us; nor will 1, as a reportes, hazard an explanation
based on dubious calculations and conjectures. Rather 1 turn to the
second item, that is, the bitterness, which I will address, now that the
whirlpools have been refuted. But first Ι will give the promised description
of the plant.

Homu, or Marine Amygdalu5‚ of the Persian Gulf

The Amygdalus marina is found in sandy locations subject to periodic
flooding by the Sea. It sends its ramose and ligneous roots deep in order
to escape injury from the waters by whose brine it is invigorated. It
