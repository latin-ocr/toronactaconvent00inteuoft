770 ERASMus's PRECATIONES

Erasmus considers it possible, even preferable, to confess one's sins
directly to God—that is to say, to obtain remission of sins through prayer.⁵

We have at our disposal an extensive treatise by Erasmus, the Modus
orandi Deum‚⁶ that is devoted to prayer specifically, and his book of
prayers, the Precationes, published in 1535. There are also numerous
statements about prayers and praying scattered throughout his other
writings as well as actual prayers incorporated in some of these writings.⁷

The Modus orandi Deum (published in 1524, revised and enlarged by
almost one fifth in 1525) is Erasmus's manual for praying. He himself
claimed that, in the Modus, he took a stance against Luther by defending
the invocation of saints.⁸ This is true, albeit that the Modus is mostly a
defense of current practices that should be tolerated‚ unless they entail
impiety or superstition. In this respect, Erasmus tends to be willing to
interpret much “in a charitable manner.” Of course Erasmus was aware
that such a lenient interpretation would allow the borderline between
“pietas'’ and “impietas‘' to fade, but it is only in his controversy with
Alberto Pio that he actually put this into words.⁹

As the title indicates, the Modus primarily focuses on the prayer to God.
Of the many bible texts that Erasmus cites and comments upon one
receives particular emphasis: “Pray without ceasing” (in the Revised Stan-
dard version: “Pray constantly‘'), from 1 Thess. 5:17. How can this exhor-
tation be brought into line with Christ's antipathy against prayers that con·
sist in “vain repetitions'' (Mt. 6:7) or as Erasmus liked to call this, using
the Greek word, “battologia.'’¹⁰ Time and again, he opposed “battolo-
gia’' and very effectively, as, for example, in his Armotationes.¹¹ According
to Erasmus, the words “Pray without ceasing” should not be taken literal-
ly, but as an indication of an inner attitude, a consistent orientation
towards God, that does not necessarily have to be expressed in words. The
