ion again in 1541.²⁰ Dolet‘s uncompromising attitude towards powerful foes
remained with him until the end—and doubtless hastened the end: shortly
before his death he published a virulent denunciation of the Inquisitor
Matthieu Orry.²¹

That Dolet's erstwhile friends had reason to distance themselves was
soon to become graphically apparent. . . . And his death, like his life,
inspired epigrammatists‚ some writing long after his death. One epigram
is friendly to Dolet: Theodore de Beze, in his Poemata of 1548, has a
picture of the Muses dampening with their tears the flames which are
consuming Dolet—until Jupiter instructs them to stop delaying his entry
into heaven (the poem was not reprinted in later editions).²² But most
are hostile.Jean Binet noted that Dolet, who had written of the destiny of
Francis Ι, has not foretold his own, and ought rather to have followed
Christ than adopted atheism and the fate that went with it. Andreas
Frusius commented gruesomely that Dolet's desire to shine brightly had been
met in the manner of his death and, in another epigram, that Dolet used to
rejoice in his belief that the soul is mortal but now grieves at the fact that it
is not. Fstienne Pasquier commented that the flames had failed to purify
Dolet and that he had sullied the flames;Jacques Servert‚ author of a work
titled L'Antidmariymloge published in Lyons in 1622, attributed to Dolet an
epigram at the moment of his execution: “Dolet is not grieving (Non dolet ipse
Dolet), but the pious crowd is”—and attributed to a bystander the cruel
rejoinder, “The pious crowd is not grieving, but dolet ipse Dolet.‘'

A good epigram moves swiftly and inevitably towards a conclusion
which is startling but which on reflection seems inevitable. Dolet's
life—brief, unpredictable, striking, memorable—has the qualities of the
epigram. And it resembles the epigram most intimately and poignantly in
that the most disconcerting, moving and memorable point comes at the
end: the epigram, wrote Guillaume Colletet, must have a “conclusion
artificieuse, surprenante, et dont la pointe vive et aigne soit capable
d’emouvoir et d’enlever l’esprit du Lecteur.’'²³ And just as the good

²¹ Dolet described Orry in the following terms: “soy disant Inquisiteur de la foy (je
nc soey si plus tost se dcbvroit appeller inquietateur d'ycelle [. . .] je n’en cogneus
jamais ung plus ignorant, ung plus maling et plus appetant la mort et destruction
d’ung Chrestien” (Dolet, Prisacessmncaises, ed. C. Lougeon, Geneve, 1979, 169.

as their (unnamed) subject, see my “Theodore de Beze and Philaenus, Bibliolhbque
d ’Humani-eme et Renaissance,” LII, 1990, 345-353.
