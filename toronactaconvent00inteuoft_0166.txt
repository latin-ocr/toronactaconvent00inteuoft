146 THE EPISTOLAE ΑΙ) EXERCITATIONEM ACCOMMODATAE

iudiciis perspectum, nullo pacto induci poteram ut in ea re temere quic-
quam te factum putarem.'' Or again one letter ends in a rather elegant
contrast: “ne cuius vita improbata fit eius orationi fidem habeas” (Furietti,
p. 231), reaffirmed by the respondent in the more emphatic indicative
mood: “Horum hominum ut vitam semper improbavi, ita numquam
orationi eorum fidem habui”(p. 231).

The prose rhythms of Barzizza in these exercises, especially at the end
of letters, are vaguely reminiscent of Ciceronian cadences but they do not
adhere to the rules of quantity nor are they confined to the usual combi-
nations of cretics and trochees found in Cicero. It must be remembered
also in this regard that even Cicero used a freer, more natural rhythm in
his letters than in his orations. In the Exercitationes Barzizza seems to favor
double trochees and double cretics rather than the cretic plus spondee.
On September 9, 1441 Guineforte Barzizza, Gasparino’s son, wrote a
letter to Gianlucido Gonzaga, student at the school of Guarino, which he
sent to accompany a copy of his father's model letters. He confers rather
fulsome praise on them: “tantam suavitatem in se habent, ut magnam
delectationem earum lectio afferre possit, tantum sucum, ut nemo tam
ieiunus atque inops in dicendo sit, qui non brevi se refectum, si avide
hauserit, atque ditatum sentiat, etc.'’¹⁴ These words may betray an exag-
gerated filial devotion, but the Exercitationes were indeed an interesting
pedagogical experiment in the history of the art of letter writing.
