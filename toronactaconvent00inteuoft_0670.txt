646 LA DANsE MACABRE AND DRURY'S MORs COMOEmA

French monumental representations of the danse macabre are wide-
spread and well researched‚ La Chaise-Dieu‚ Auvergne (c. 1400), SS
Innocents in Paris (c. 1425) and Kenmaria in Brittany (c. 1440) being
perhaps those known best.²

When, during the Middle Ages, thinking was focussed on the life to
come and when, furthermore, Death’s ubiquity was brought home to
everyone by endless waves of the plague that swept Europe, it was little
wonder that the subject of death‘s triumphant dance, starting as mere
illuminations without accompanying texts, found its way into the decora-
tive margins of manuscript books of hours for private devotion.

German Blockbooks³ took up the subject and added a text, closely
followed by the new art of printing. Guyot Marchant saw a market for it
when he first published La danse macabre in Paris in 1485, followed, before
1500, by fourteen other editions.‘¹ Accompanied by the French verses
from the cemetery of SS Innocents, the book was enlarged both in text
and in pictures almost from edition to edition. Apart from a Latin version
of 1490,⁵ there seem to be no early German,⁶ English or other vernacu-
lar editions of Marchant's Dame among the incunabula,⁷ but the subject
of the danse macabre was passed on in Le Kalendrier des bergiers, the Shep-
heard's Calendar, the Schcifer-Kalender.⁸

⁶ Der Doten danz mit figuren (Heidelberg: Heinrich Knoblochzer, c. 1488), fol„
though, seems to rely on some of Marchant’s woodcuts and verses.

⁸ As recent studies have shown, a considerable part of the literary and illustrative
material of the Danse found its way into another best-selling book of Marchant's, Le
Kalendrier des bergiers, first published in 1491 and from there, after the turn of the
century, by way osa “British'' (Duff) and English translations into England. Cp. by the
