natural phenomena‚ and thus it is not difficult to find resonances and
reverberations throughout holy writ: in this case, the tree in Psalm 1
reminds him of so many others, from the tree in Eden to the tree by the
waters in the Apocalypse; most importantly for Erasmus's Christology, the
list includes the vine and its branches, and the cross [185A-F]. Christ's
own unpretentious use of metaphor does nothing to impair Erasmus’s
case [cf. 183E1. His own commentaries are often inspired by the Psalms'
welcome directness and vividness of style; as well as adding metaphors of
his own, for example on the arboreal theme [196C], he includes passages
of well—paced dialogue or invective [e.g.‚ 197A and 20513] and compelling
visual images, such as that of the prophet in his watch-tower halfway
between heaven and earth [261Β].

One oddity about Erasmus’s literary appreciation of the Psalms is of
course his ignorance of Hebrew. To fill the gap he turned to Jerome and,
interestingly, to Nicolas of Lyra,¹⁰ for information on the most obscure
and controversial readings, but his concern for effect rather than accuracy,
shocking to many contemporary theologiam, led him to conclude that the
Greek and Latin versions provided all the inspiration necessary to the
commentator [e.g., 193D]. Discussing the meaning of the word bar in
Syriae and Hebrew, he makes a less than respectful pun about not “cud-
gelling our brains with the complexities of these barbaric languages'’
[230D] and later skips mern‘ly away from a Hebrew conundrum with the
remark that “no language is more confusing nor more open to misinter-
pretation and disagreement” [267DJ. Modern Hebrew scholars have
demonstrated the coherence of the psalms as songs of praise or prophecy
in the Jewish tradition, but Erasmus had to gloss over apparent logical
lapses:

It is not essentia} that every part of a prophecy should fit perfectly
into either an historical or an allegorical reading, because often
certain elements are included to ensure chronological coherence
whilst others, which are out of place in the histon'cal context, compel
us to have recourse to allegory. [213D]

Erasmus's cavalier approach to the texts is nowhere clearer than in his
comments on a particularly knotty verse of Psalm 4 [v. 2] where the
Hebrew, Greek and Latin versions all seem to suggest something different:

¹⁰ See LB 5 200E, where Erasmus chides the l4th-century Franciscan for disrespect
towards Jerome, but also 2023, an unacknowledged borrowing from Nicolas's Postilla
super psalterium.
