manage to catch only the formal aspects of the new Netherlandish art,
without grasping, however, its intrinsic meaning or content. Thus, no
mention is made of its hallmark, according to Irwin Panofsky, the all-
pervading Christian symbolism in disguise.¹⁶ And yet these humanists did
the best they could. In their defence it must be admitted that their Roman
models must have been even more unfit for the description of the works
of the Italian Renaissance. In them they would find no words to character—
ize the hard-cut, crystalline stereometry of form or the empty extension of
space in a Masaccio or a Piero de la Francesca.

From this we may conclude that either his humanist colleagues did not
fully understand the Albertian innovation as regards the concept of art,
announced in his treatise on painting, or they were more intent on the
renewal of their own branch of art, that of rhetoric, than on a revolution
of the visual arts‚ In the long run, however, it was the Albertian concept
of art that triumphed as the concept on which Western pictorial tradition
was built, until, at the end of the previous century, the decomposition of
the continuity of perspective space began with the Expressionists and
other early Modernists.¹⁷

In spite of this, art cn'tics throughout the whole of this period, from the
father of Raphael, Giovanni Santi, to the so-called father of modern art
criticism, Denis Diderot, continued to derive profit from the Roman
authors, preferably Pliny the Elder, so as to flavour with their eloquence
their own observations on contemporary artistic production.¹⁸ But when
judging these borrowings‚ it must constantly be born in mind that they
were brought into function in quite a new context, involving quite a
different idea of reality as well as a different concept of the visual arts‚ not
as an imitation of the factual world of things, but as an artistic creation,
through re-construction, of a new fictitious reality.
