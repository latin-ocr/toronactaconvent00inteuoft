180 LEARNED SCANDINAVIAN WOMEN

learned women-as well as so many learned womenl—is no doubt due
primarily to Otto Sperling (1634-1715). His work is from the decades
around 1700. It was in Latin, and even though it was never published, it
became known in wide circles both inside Denmark and abroad.

Otto Sperling The Younger's “De foeminis doctis'' is found today in a
manuscript in The Royal Library in Copenhagen. Sperling began as a
lawyer but was far more interested in humanistic studies, which he cultivat-
ed with emphasis on ancient literature, history, and numismatics.⁷ During
the years between 1681 and 1683 Sperling was associated with Colbert's
library in Paris and later lived in Hamburg for several years. One of
Sperling's goals in life was to collect information on the learned women of
the entire world. At his death his collection consisted of 1399 biographies
of women written in Latin.

His collection of information on learned women extended over several
decades, and his plan was to complete the work for publication around
1700. The lack of a publisher and resources—and perhaps the lack of
ability to turn a collection into a finished work—most probably explains
why he did not succeed in preparing his work for publication prior to his
death. But the inspi ration derived from Otto Sperling is clearly that which
gave rise to most of the remaining Danish gynaecea.

In Sperling's Latin correspondence we find a number of letters to and
from men which deal with the learned woman and which reveal the
method he used to establish his collection. In addition he had an extreme-
ly unusual talent and desire for encouraging the women he was in contact
with to write. This is also evident in his correspondence, where there are
more letters to and from women than 1 have found with any other person
from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Scandinavia.⁸ Several
autobiographical accounts in Latin by Scandinavian women are of particu-
lar interest. The finest example of such correspondence is that between
Otto Sperling and the learned Swedish woman, Sophia Elisabeth Brenner.
It consists of a little over 25 letters in Latin.

In addition to the gynaecea, we have the women’s own works. Τὴε
material is extensive, but rarely in Latin. From the women in the seven-
teenth century we have in particular: literature on Christian upbringing,
