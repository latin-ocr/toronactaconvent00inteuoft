346 CAROLUS SIGONIUS

(1552-1560) and, later, as professor of rhetoric at Padua (1560-1584), he
defended the revival of classical Latin; commented on selected works of
Aristotle, including the Rhetoric; and edited fragments of Cicero’s lost
writings (De consolatione, 1583). His interests also extended to history.
Working diligently in archives and libraries, and taking advantage of
archaeological findings, he published his Fasti consulares (1550), which
chronicles the history of Rome, and his De regno Italiae (1580), which
traces the development of the Italian kingdom from the invasion of the
Lombards in 568 to the end of the thirteenth century. The quantity and
significance of his historical writings have shifted attention away from his
contributions in philology and literary criticism‚ in general, and from his
definition of dialogue, in particular.

Sigonius’s eighteenth- and nineteenth-century biographers, L. A.
Muratori (1732-37)‚ J B. Krebs (1840) and G. Franciosi (1872) allude to

his treatise on the dialogue‚³ and scholars, such as Moustapha Benouis
and C. J. R. Armstrong, have noted the significance of this work.‘¹ Only
Bernard Weinberg and, more recently‚ K. J Wilson have examined some
of the principal points of Sigonius's theory.⁵ However, in the preface to
Sigonius's De dialogo published in Leipzig in 1596, the editor Johannes
Jessenius reminds us of the importance of this treatise.⁶ According to

1596). All page references correspond to this edition. Α more modern edition is
