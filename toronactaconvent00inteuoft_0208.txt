184 LEARNED scANDINAleN WOMEN

How Learned Were the Learned Women?

Roughly, we have the names of around 130 Dano—Norwegian so-called
“learned women” and around 25 Swedish. They were, of course, not all
equally learned, and in this connection it could be interesting to have a
look at the way in which they regarded Latin.

In the year 1700 Matthias Henriksen Schacht published an article in
Latin in which 36 Dano-Norwegian women were mentioned, the first
printed Dano-Norwegian gynaeceum.¹³ This article gave rise to a debate.
A well-known bishop in Jutland, Jens Bircherod (1658-1708), initiated a
discussion about it with the leading expert on learned women, Otto
Sperling. In many ways, Bircherod symbolizes the traditional learned Latin
humanist. He was worried by the threat of inflation in the notion of
learning. Anybody at all, or rather any old woman, could call herself
learned if there were no fixed guidelines to indicate what actually com-
prised learning.

Indeed, if merely knowledge of the French language or of some
other foreign language is enough to be praised for being a learned
woman, then your “learned chamber of women” will no doubt grow
tremendously

he wrote to Sperling in 170214

Bircherod stipulates knowledge of Latin as the minimum requirement
for bearing the title of learned: On this basis he can quickly shorten
Schacht’s list. His first task was to separate the women into groups accord-
ing to their so—called learning. The first group was made up of the authors
of prayer books. This group had nine members. “They can be counted as
national authors, but they cannot rise to the heights of those women who
have absorbed ‘laudable scholarship’ '' in his opinion. Group two consisted
of women who had published, or had intended to publish, various didactic
treatises. Eight in all. Group three comprised women who were familiar
with French, German, English, or other foreign languages, which he
termed “linguas exoticas,'’ but not Latin. Thus he got n'd of another five.
Group four had only two members, Anne Gjoe and Karen Brahe. They
