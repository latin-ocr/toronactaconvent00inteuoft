190 THE POLITICS 01² IRENICISM

religion, which ought to have been a principle of harmony, now served to
divide the intellectual community. Personal contact was inhibited and even
the free exchange of writings was problematic: “for what can now be
received in Italy from the Germans or the Swiss without grave distrust?
And what Italian work does not find detractors ready among the Germans
and Swiss?” When Sadoleto touches on the greater brilliance of the Italian
poets Sphinter counters that “nostri homines”—-here one senses that the
reference is as much confessional as ethnic-were too sensitive to theologi-
cal matters to approve the mingling of pagan and Christian elements
within the same volume. This, he concludes, is the reason for the lower
status of poetry “apud nostros.''

Sadoleto's response was to recall a proposal which he had first aired
some years before in a letter to a printer for a volume that would bring
together outstanding poems which combined classical literary elegance
with religious inspiration. While he was ready to acknowledge the achieve-
ment of non-Italians, both in scholarship and literary studies, it was to his
own countrymen that he turned in the first place for the reconciliation of
Christian teaching with classical forms, and the names that are put for-
ward are those of Sannazaro‚ Paleario, Vida and Marcantonio Flaminio.³
What Sadoleto is recalling here is a letter he had sent to the Lyonnais
printer Sebastian Gryphius in September 1535; this is of some interest
since it was written in his excitement after an initial reading of Paleario’s
De immortalitate animorum. Gryphius, to whom we shall return later, was
another example of a printer who exploited the shifting boundary be-
tween orthodoxy and reform and Sadoleto‚ as bishop of Carpentras‚ had
frequent dealings with him. The letter about Paleario's poem recommends
its publication and suggests the suitability of printing it with works by
Sannazaro and Vida. What excites Sadoleto's enthusiasm is Paleario's
clarity of expression in handling a complex topic, combined with the
classical propriety of his verse. But he is careful to emphasise that his
response is not confined to the literary or even the intellectual level: the
most important quality of the work is its subjective force which takes the
reader beyond the level of didactic utility to inflame the soul with love of
true religion.‘¹

eruditionem, nonnunquam etiam eloquentiam concedebat: Italos vero affirmabat
imitationis studiossisimus‚ novis in rebus effinxisse, atque expressisse imaginem
antiquitatis'’ (a2v-a3r). Sadoleto places the issue of religious poetry at the centre of
the dispute over imitation.
