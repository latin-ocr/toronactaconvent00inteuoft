The proposal which Sadoleto aired in his letter to Gryphius is tacitly
accepted as the model for Oporinus‘s volume and its very title, Pii, graves,
elegantes poetae aliquot, echoes his ideal of Christian eloquence. The greater
part of the contenis follows his prescription and is Italian in on‘gin:
Sannazaro’s De Partu Virginis and De morte Christi lamentatio are there, so
are Vida’s Christiad, Paleario’s De Immortalitate animorum and a number of
verse psalm translations by Marcantonio Flaminio. But then some transal-
pine items are added: Flaminio's twenty-six psalms are supplemented by
Sebastian Castellio’s Odae in Psalmos XL and included with them is an ode
by Florentius Volusenus, the Florens Wilson of my title, which is modelled
on Horace’s “Sic te diva potens Cypri” (Car-mimam, 1.3) and treats the
familiar humanist theme of “tranquillitas animi’' in a resolutely evangelical
manner. Castellio is the junior contributor: born in Savoy in 1515 he is
best known as Calvin’s opponent over freedom of conscience in the
Servetus affair of 1553-1554. After leaving Geneva for Basle in 1545 he
worked in Oporinus's printing house and the inclusion of so much of his
recent work in the volume suggests some degree of personal involvement.
He may also have been responsible for the inclusion of Wilson‘s ode since
he must certainly have encountered him during his stay in Lyons in the
late 1530’s when Wilson was associated with the College de la Tn'nite and
was a friend of Gryphius. But Wilson was in any case known to Sadoleto,
with whom he corresponded as late as 1546 on the delicate topic of
confessional affiliation, and his name was not unknown in Switzerland. His
Commentatio Theologiea, first printed by Gryphius in 1539, had been
reprinted in Basle by Hieronymous Cun'o in 1544, very probably at the
prompting of Conrad Gesner who had met Wilson in Lyons and clearly
admired his writings.⁵

Now 1 have gone into these details about the genesis of Oporinus’s
anthology for a purpose: it provides an apt illustmtion of the network of
contacts and of shared aspirations which marks the Neo-Latin community
in the early decades of the Reformation period. Sadoleto, like his friend
Reginald Pole, was suspect as being too familiar with heretics, if not
actually heterodox himself, and his earnest support of Paleario when the
latter was under suspicion in 1542 did his posthumous reputation little
