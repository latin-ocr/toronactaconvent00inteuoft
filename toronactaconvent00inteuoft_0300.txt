276 THE RENAISSANCE COMMENTATORS ΟΝ STATIUS

When he died in 1518, Christophorous Saxus, his former pupil, succeeded
him as professor of eloquence at Perugia. Maturantius' commentary on the
Achilleid was first printed in Venice in 1483 by Octavianus Scotus, the famous
edition which also contains the commentanes of Lactantius Placidus on the
Thebaid and Domitius Calderinus on the Silvae. From 1490 to 1508 Maturan-
tius' commentary on the Achilleid was reprinted at least ten times. In addition
to his explication of the Achilleid, he wrote commentaries on Cicero’s De
Officiis, Philippioe and Quaestiones Tusculanae, and on Rhetorica ad Herennium
a life of the jurisconsult Pier-Filippo della Corgna3 an ojmczdum de componen-
dis versibus hexametro et pentametro; and a chronicle of Perugia from 1492 to
1503. His letters are preserved in the Vatican Archives (MSS. 5358 and 5890)
and the librasy of Perugia.

Joannes Britannicus was born at Palazzuolo and was a member of the
same family as the printers Jacopo and Angiolo Britannico.⁶ There is not
very much information regarding his early education and career. He
studied at Padua from 1470 to 1471 and taught Latin at Brescia for many
years. By a decree confirmed on 31 March 1519‚Joannes Britannicus and
his descendants were given the right to hold office in Brescia. He pub-
lished his commentary on the Achilleid in 1485 at Brescia where it was
printed by Jacobus Britannicus. It was reprinted at Paris in 1618 by Tho.
Blaise and at Leiden in 1671 by Hackius. Besides his commentary on the
Achilleid and notes on the Silvae, Britannicus wrote commentaries on
Horace, Juvenal, Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and Persius, and edited Lucan,
Pliny, Sallust, and Terence.

Joannes Bernartius was the last of the Neo-Latin commentators on
Statius.⁷ He was born at Mechlin (Mechelen) in 1568 and took the degree
