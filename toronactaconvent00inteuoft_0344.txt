520 LITERARY HYBRIDIZING IN THE RENAISSANCE

The Cohonatio is an elaborate, twenty—seven page discourse in the form
of an oration in which the first person speaker appeals directly to Emper-
or Charles V and French King Henri II to make peace. The orator speaks
to Charles and Henri in turn, urging each to make peace with arguments
that are not just abstractions but are appropriate to their personalities and
political positions and ambitions. He refers, for instance, to their relative
ages, their persona} histories and military careers and to the actual military
situation. Each argument, and they go on for twenty-seven pages, is
tailored to suit the circumstance of one or the other ruler and, in the
apparent conviction that the author is speaking forJesus Christ himself, is
put with great forcefulness and authority. He tells Charles for instance
that he is too old to keep up this war and Henri that he will only bankrupt
his country and lose the personal glory he already has as well as his soul.
The old notion of a single European Holy Empire politically united under
one head has long since given way to the new nationalism and the leaders
had better come to terms with reality and learn to live in peace. Since
neither is strong enough to annihilate the other, peace is the only possible
alternative to their impossible dream of domination. It is also the perfect
opportunity for each to satisfy his own personal aspirations: Charles can
retire covered with glory and Henri can be secure in his r61e as national
hero. They can both take comfort in the knowledge that Europe will
remain united in its common Christian faith of which they themselves are
the exemplars. Meanwhile they can conduct themselves as true—and
equal—rulers by providing their subjects with what they need most: protec-
tion of their religion, which is being attacked from within, and justice for
all. This is God’s will for them both and it is God, not they, who is master
of destiny. Above all, they should look to their future—eternal beatitude
and glory for posterity.

This, then, is a simulated deliberative oration with all requisite parts
very clearly distinguishable: the exordium with its captatio benevolentiae and
effected modesty; the narratio and confirmatio setting out the facts and
proofs with accompanying objections and refutations‚ a model epideictic
digression and the brief but sufficient conclusio. The writing betrays a
genuine feeling for Ciceronian stylistic practice and it has all the ampli-
tude, rhythms‚ and richness of diction that the master could have hoped
to pass on. In other words, its rhetorical credentials are impeccable‚

Of course, rhetoric had in one way or another determined almost all
forms and modes of public communication in Europe since ancient times.
Various schools of thought on the subject alternatively stressed the character
and qualities of speaker, speech or audience, producing theories about the
ideal man, the orator, about the ideally ordered, expressed and delivered dis-
